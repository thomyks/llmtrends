The direct collapse black hole (DCBH) mechanism is not required but\nis not excluded. Furthermore, the results show the following. The\nmass-accretion rate increases exponentially from the seed's inception at z ~30,\nreaches a broad plateau at z ~ 8.5 to 6 coincident with the epoch of\nreionization, and decreases monotonically towards z=0. Sub-Eddington accretion\nis the norm, except during the first ~150 Myr, SMBHs experienced\nsuper-Eddington accretion, or the radiative efficiency was <0.1. The largest\nseed can potentially grow via luminous accretion up to (6.6+/-2.2)E+10 Msun,\nconsistent with a theoretical limit of ~ 5+10 Msun proposed by King. The\nEddington ratio decreases, and the radiative efficiency increases as z\ndecreases, consistent with recent findings.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Sun, 12 Dec 2021 22:23:55 GMT"}, {"version": "v2", "created": "Sun, 26 Jun 2022 19:29:31 GMT"}, {"version": "v3", "created": "Thu, 28 Jul 2022 04:20:33 GMT"}, {"version": "v4", "created": "Tue, 23 Aug 2022 03:22:37 GMT"}, {"version": "v5", "created": "Thu, 19 Sep 2024 04:04:35 GMT"}, {"version": "v6", "created": "Thu, 13 Mar 2025 00:42:07 GMT"}], "update_date": "2025-03-14", "authors_parsed": [["Aggarwal", "Yash", ""]]}

On the\nother hand, monadic stability is a property expressed in purely model-theoretic\nterms and hence it is also suited for capturing structure in dense graphs.\n  For several years, it has been suspected that one can create a structure\ntheory for monadically stable graph classes that mirrors the theory of nowhere\ndense graph classes in the dense setting. In this work we provide a step in\nthis direction by giving a characterization of monadic stability through the\nFlipper game: a game on a graph played by Flipper, who in each round can\ncomplement the edge relation between any pair of vertex subsets, and Connector,\nwho in each round localizes the game to a ball of bounded radius.

However, how to compactly deliver the LWFA-based\nVHEE beams of relatively large energy spread and create a maximum dose deeply\ninside the body remains very challenging. In this article, we present a simple\ndose delivery scheme utilizing only two dipole magnets for LWFA-based VHEE\ntreatment. By adjusting the magnet strengths, the electron beams can be guided\nalong different angular trajectories towards a precise position as deep as 20\ncm within a water phantom, creating a maximum dose over the target region and\nsignificantly reducing the entrance dose. Supported by Monte Carlo simulations,\nsuch a beam delivery approach is demonstrated to be insensitive to the beam\nenergy spread and meanwhile capable of controlling precisely the dose-peak\nposition in both lateral and longitudinal directions. As such, a uniform dose\npeak can be generated by the weighted sum of VHEE beams that reach different\ndose-peak depths.

Thus, the hidden factors of\nlarge kernel convolution that affect model performance remain unexplored. In\nthis paper, we reveal that the key hidden factors of large kernels can be\nsummarized as two separate components: extracting features at a certain\ngranularity and fusing features by multiple pathways. To this end, we leverage\nthe multi-path long-distance sparse dependency relationship to enhance feature\nutilization via the proposed Shiftwise (SW) convolution operator with a pure\nCNN architecture. In a wide range of vision tasks such as classification,\nsegmentation, and detection, SW surpasses state-of-the-art transformers and CNN\narchitectures, including SLaK and UniRepLKNet.

The presence of\nextensive missing values in EHR makes it challenging for deep neural networks\n(DNNs) to directly model the patient's health status. Existing DNNs training\nprotocols, including Impute-then-Regress Procedure and Jointly Optimizing of\nImpute-n-Regress Procedure, require the additional imputation models to\nreconstruction missing values. However, Impute-then-Regress Procedure\nintroduces the risk of injecting imputed, non-real data into downstream\nclinical prediction tasks, resulting in power loss, biased estimation, and\npoorly performing models, while Jointly Optimizing of Impute-n-Regress\nProcedure is also difficult to generalize due to the complex optimization space\nand demanding data requirements. Inspired by the recent advanced literature of\nlearnable prompt in the fields of NLP and CV, in this work, we rethought the\nnecessity of the imputation model in downstream clinical tasks, and proposed\nLearnable Prompt as Pseudo-Imputation (PAI) as a new training protocol to\nassist EHR analysis. PAI no longer introduces any imputed data but constructs a\nlearnable prompt to model the implicit preferences of the downstream model for\nmissing values, resulting in a significant performance improvement for all\nstate-of-the-arts EHR analysis models on four real-world datasets across two\nclinical prediction tasks. Further experimental analysis indicates that PAI\nexhibits higher robustness in situations of data insufficiency and high missing\nrates.

We improve upon these methods with\nSMIRK (Spatial Modeling for Image-based Reconstruction of Kinesics), which\nfaithfully reconstructs expressive 3D faces from images. We identify two key\nlimitations in existing methods: shortcomings in their self-supervised training\nformulation, and a lack of expression diversity in the training images. For\ntraining, most methods employ differentiable rendering to compare a predicted\nface mesh with the input image, along with a plethora of additional loss\nfunctions. This differentiable rendering loss not only has to provide\nsupervision to optimize for 3D face geometry, camera, albedo, and lighting,\nwhich is an ill-posed optimization problem, but the domain gap between\nrendering and input image further hinders the learning process. Instead, SMIRK\nreplaces the differentiable rendering with a neural rendering module that,\ngiven the rendered predicted mesh geometry, and sparsely sampled pixels of the\ninput image, generates a face image. As the neural rendering gets color\ninformation from sampled image pixels, supervising with neural rendering-based\nreconstruction loss can focus solely on the geometry. Further, it enables us to\ngenerate images of the input identity with varying expressions while training.\nThese are then utilized as input to the reconstruction model and used as\nsupervision with ground truth geometry. This effectively augments the training\ndata and enhances the generalization for diverse expressions. Our qualitative,\nquantitative and particularly our perceptual evaluations demonstrate that SMIRK\nachieves the new state-of-the art performance on accurate expression\nreconstruction.

Since conventional simulations using the finite element method\nentail a high computational cost, in this article we aim to develop a machine\nlearning-based approach that scales favorably to serve as a surrogate model. To\nensure that the model is also able to handle various microstructures, including\nthose not encountered during training, we include the microstructure as part of\nthe network input. Therefore, we introduce a graph neural network that predicts\nglobal quantities (energy, stress stiffness) as well as the pattern\ntransformations that occur (the kinematics). To make our model as accurate and\ndata-efficient as possible, various symmetries are incorporated into the model.\nThe starting point is an E(n)-equivariant graph neural network (which respects\ntranslation, rotation and reflection) that has periodic boundary conditions\n(i.e., it is in-/equivariant with respect to the choice of RVE), is scale\nin-/equivariant, can simulate large deformations, and can predict scalars,\nvectors as well as second and fourth order tensors (specifically energy, stress\nand stiffness). The incorporation of scale equivariance makes the model\nequivariant with respect to the similarities group, of which the Euclidean\ngroup E(n) is a subgroup. We show that this network is more accurate and\ndata-efficient than graph neural networks with fewer symmetries. To create an\nefficient graph representation of the finite element discretization, we use\nonly the internal geometrical hole boundaries from the finite element mesh to\nachieve a better speed-up and scaling with the mesh size.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Fri, 26 Apr 2024 12:30:32 GMT"}, {"version": "v2", "created": "Mon, 9 Dec 2024 15:10:19 GMT"}, {"version": "v3", "created": "Thu, 13 Mar 2025 14:48:27 GMT"}], "update_date": "2025-03-14", "authors_parsed": [["Hendriks", "Fleur", ""], ["Menkovski", "Vlado", ""], ["Do\u0161k\u00e1\u0159", "Martin", ""], ["Geers", "Marc G.

Unlike the usual construction in standard quantum\nmechanics, mixed quantum-classical systems involve the interplay of unitary\noperators acting on the quantum observables and the Lagrangian trajectories\nsweeping the classical degrees of freedom. This interplay reflects an intricate\nstructure which is made particularly challenging by the backreaction excerpted\non the classical trajectories by the quantum degrees of freedom. While the\nbackreaction is underestimated in the common Ehrenfest model, more recent\nmethodologies succeed in capturing this important effect by resorting to\nKoopman wavefunctions in classical mechanics.

Recently, the most\ngeneral scalar field action yielding a conformally invariant second-order\nequation was constructed, and entails a more involved nonminimal coupling\nexplicitly breaking the conformal invariance of the action without spoiling it\nin the equation. We have succeeded in fully describing the spherically\nsymmetric stealth solutions on flat spacetime supporting the Cheshire effect\nwithin this general non-Noetherian conformal theory. The allowed configurations\nare divided into two branches: The first one essentially corresponds to an\nextension of the solutions already known for the standard Noetherian conformal\ntheory. The second branch is only possible due to the non-Noetherian conformal\ncontribution of the action. The complete characterization of this branch is\nexpressed by a nonlinear first-order partial differential equation. We have\nfound the general solution of this equation using both seemingly new and\nwell-established mathematical tools.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Wed, 31 Jul 2024 18:01:47 GMT"}, {"version": "v2", "created": "Thu, 13 Mar 2025 03:42:05 GMT"}], "update_date": "2025-03-14", "authors_parsed": [["Ay\u00f3n-Beato", "Eloy", ""], ["Hassaine", "Mokhtar", ""], ["S\u00e1nchez", "Pedro A.", ""]]}

We study optimal demand response\nin a setting where consumers use home energy management systems (HEMS) to\nautonomously adjust their electricity consumption. Our core assumption is that\nHEMS operationalize flexibility by querying the consumer for their preferences\nand computing the ``indifference set'' of all energy consumption profiles that\ncan be used to satisfy these preferences.

To accomplish\nlong-horizon tasks, one of the most feasible ways is to decompose abstract\ninstructions into a sequence of actionable steps.

However, providing highly relevant\nexamples for any random task is unpractical. Therefore, we present ReLEP, a\nnovel framework for Real-time Long-horizon Embodied Planning. ReLEP can\ncomplete a wide range of long-horizon tasks without in-context examples by\nlearning implicit logical inference through fine-tuning. The fine-tuned large\nvision-language model formulates plans as sequences of skill functions. These\nfunctions are selected from a carefully designed skill library. ReLEP is also\nequipped with a Memory module for plan and status recall, and a Robot\nConfiguration module for versatility across robot types. In addition, we\npropose a data generation pipeline to tackle dataset scarcity. When\nconstructing the dataset, we considered the implicit logical relationships,\nenabling the model to learn implicit logical relationships and dispel\nhallucinations.

We apply this framework to the widely used zero-forcing\n(ZF) communication beamforming technique, to assess their impact on the radar\nsubsystem's performance. Additionally, two optimisation problems are\nformulated: the first optimise the radar subsystem's KLD under communication\nconstraints, and the second focuses on communication waveform KLD optimisation\nwith constraints on the radar KLD. These problems are solved using a projected\ngradient method with adaptive penalties for the radar waveforms and a\ngradient-assisted interior point method (IPM) for the communication waveforms.\nAs performance benchmarks, we propose two additional optimisation frameworks: a\nradar waveform optimisation with bit error rate (BE) constraints and a\ncommunication waveform optimisation that minimises BER under radar KLD\nconstraints. Theoretical derivations and simulations show that our KLD-based\napproach effectively characterises and optimises the ISAC performance\ntrade-offs.

One of the\ncorner stones of the connections between the non-relativistic condensed matter\nand the modern relativistic theories is the two-fluid hydrodynamics of\nsuperfluid helium. The dynamics and thermodynamics of the de Sitter state of\nthe expansion of the Universe bear some features of the multi-fluid system.\nThere are actually three components: the quantum vacuum, the gravitational\ncomponent and relativistic matter. The expanding de Sitter vacuum serves as the\nthermal bath with local temperature, which is twice the Gibbons-Hawking\ntemperature related to the cosmological horizon. This local temperature leads\nto the heating of matter component and the gravitational component. The latter\nbehaves as Zel'dovich stiff matter and represents the dark matter. In\nequilibrium and in the absence of the conventional matter the positive partial\npressure of dark matter compensates the negative partial pressure of quantum\nvacuum. That is why in the full equilibrium the total pressure is zero. This is\nsimilar to the superfluid and normal components in superfluids, which together\nproduce the zero pressure of the liquid in the absence of environment. If one\nassumes that in dynamics, the gravitational dark matter behaves as the real\nZel'dovich stiff matter, one obtains that both components experience the power\nlaw decay due to the energy exchange between these components.

Existing NPE methods typically rely on normalizing\nflows, which approximate a distribution by composing many simple, invertible\ntransformations.

Our results show\nthat, across a highly varied suite of benchmarking problems for NPE\narchitectures, diffusions offer improved stability, superior accuracy, and\nfaster training times, even with simpler, shallower models.

However, current machine learning (ML) models\ndesigned to analyze these datasets often lack interpretability and\nidentifiability guarantees, which are essential for biomedical research. Recent\nadvances in causal representation learning have shown promise in identifying\ninterpretable latent causal variables with formal theoretical guarantees.\nUnfortunately, most current work on multimodal distributions either relies on\nrestrictive parametric assumptions or yields only coarse identification\nresults, limiting their applicability to biomedical research that favors a\ndetailed understanding of the mechanisms.\n  In this work, we aim to develop flexible identification conditions for\nmultimodal data and principled methods to facilitate the understanding of\nbiomedical datasets. Theoretically, we consider a nonparametric latent\ndistribution (c.f., parametric assumptions in previous work) that allows for\ncausal relationships across potentially different modalities. We establish\nidentifiability guarantees for each latent component, extending the subspace\nidentification results from previous work. Our key theoretical contribution is\nthe structural sparsity of causal connections between modalities, which, as we\nwill discuss, is natural for a large collection of biomedical systems.\nEmpirically, we present a practical framework to instantiate our theoretical\ninsights. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach through extensive\nexperiments on both numerical and synthetic datasets.

The analysis\nis performed in the very low dielectron invariant mass-squared region between\n$0.0009$ and $0.2615\\,{\\rm GeV}^2\\!/c^4$. The longitudinal polarisation\nfraction of the $\\phi$ meson is measured to be less than $11.5\\%$ at $90\\%$\nconfidence level. The $A_{\\mathrm{T}}^{\\mathcal{R}e C\\!P}$ observable, which is\nrelated to the lepton forward-backward asymmetry, is measured to be $0.116 \\pm\n0.155 \\pm 0.006$, where the first uncertainty is statistical and the second\nsystematic. The transverse asymmetries, $A_{\\mathrm{T}}^{(2)}$ and\n$A_{\\mathrm{T}}^{\\mathcal{I}m C\\!P}$, which are sensitive to the virtual photon\npolarisation, are found to be $-0.045 \\pm 0.235 \\pm 0.014$ and $0.002 \\pm 0.247\n\\pm 0.016$, respectively.

To reduce the acquisition\ntime, fast MRI reconstruction aims to restore high-quality images from the\nundersampled k-space. Existing methods typically train deep learning models to\nmap the undersampled data to artifact-free MRI images. However, these studies\noften overlook the unique properties of k-space and directly apply general\nnetworks designed for image processing to k-space recovery, leaving the precise\nlearning of k-space largely underexplored. In this work, we propose a\ncontinuous k-space recovery network from a new perspective of implicit neural\nrepresentation with image domain guidance, which boosts the performance of MRI\nreconstruction. Specifically, (1) an implicit neural representation based\nencoder-decoder structure is customized to continuously query unsampled\nk-values. (2) an image guidance module is designed to mine the semantic\ninformation from the low-quality MRI images to further guide the k-space\nrecovery. (3) a multi-stage training strategy is proposed to recover dense\nk-space progressively. Extensive experiments conducted on CC359, fastMRI, and\nIXI datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of our method and its superiority\nover other competitors.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Mon, 18 Nov 2024 04:54:04 GMT"}, {"version": "v2", "created": "Thu, 13 Mar 2025 12:40:10 GMT"}], "update_date": "2025-03-14", "authors_parsed": [["Meng", "Yucong", ""], ["Yang", "Zhiwei", ""], ["Duan", "Minghong", ""], ["Shi", "Yonghong", ""], ["Song", "Zhijian", ""]]}

In this paper, we resolve this discrepancy by\nconsidering an expanded set of magnetic configurations, which reveals a\nferromagnetic in-plane exchange interaction in agreement with experimental\nfindings. Additionally, we demonstrate that the 10th nearest-neighbor exchange\ninteraction is directionally dependent, inducing a nonrelativistic chiral\nsplitting in the magnon bands, as recently observed experimentally. We further\nshow that applying a compressive strain may significantly enhance both\nnonrelativistic spin and chiral magnon splittings. The strain can also change\nthe sign of the in-plane exchange interaction. Computing magnetic\nsusceptibility, we show that strain enhances the N{\\'e}el temperature,\nsignificantly.

Prior knowledge of customer\ninterruption cost (CIC) and load restoration behaviors, particularly cold load\npickup (CLPU), is essential for effective decision-making. However, both CIC\nand CLPU are reciprocally influenced by the realized customer interruption\nduration (CID), making them decision-dependent and challenging to model,\nespecially given the limited understanding of their underlying physical\nmechanisms. This paper proposes a novel and tractable modeling approach to\ncapture the varying patterns of CIC and CLPU with CID - patterns derived from\ndata that reflect observable surface - level correlations rather than\nunderlying mechanisms - thereby enabling practical surrogate modeling of these\ndecision-dependent factors. Specifically, quadratic functions are employed to\nmodel the increasing rate of CIC with respect to CID according to data fitting\nresults. For CLPU, several defining characteristics are extracted and modeled\nin a piecewise linear form relative to CID, and the actual restored load\naccounting for CLPU is subsequently reconstructed. Building on these models, a\nPDS restoration optimization framework is developed, incorporating mobile\nenergy storage systems (MESSs) and network reconfiguration strategies.

These are important for\ntime-series tasks and logical reasoning. Traditional RNNs like LSTMs and GRUs,\nas well as modern variants like sLSTM do have these capabilities at the cost of\nstrictly sequential processing. While this is often seen as a strong\nlimitation, we show how fast these networks can get with our\nhardware-optimization FlashRNN in Triton and CUDA, optimizing kernels to the\nregister level on modern GPUs. We extend traditional RNNs with a\nparallelization variant that processes multiple RNNs of smaller hidden state in\nparallel, similar to the head-wise processing in Transformers. To enable\nflexibility on different GPU variants, we introduce a new optimization\nframework for hardware-internal cache sizes, memory and compute handling. It\nmodels the hardware in a setting using polyhedral-like constraints, including\nthe notion of divisibility. This speeds up the solution process in our\nConstrINT library for general integer constraint satisfaction problems (integer\nCSPs). We show that our kernels can achieve 50x speed-ups over a vanilla\nPyTorch implementation and allow 40x larger hidden sizes compared to our Triton\nimplementation.

Other common methods, such as parametric design or data-driven\napproaches, are limited by either the lack of diversity in geometry or the\ndifficulty to extrapolate from known data, respectively. In this work, we\nformulate the simultaneous exploration of multiple competing material\nproperties as a multi-objective optimization (MOO) problem and employ a\nneuroevolution algorithm to efficiently solve it. The Compositional\nPattern-Producing Networks (CPPNs) is used as the generative model for unit\ncell designs, which provide very compact yet lossless encoding of geometry. A\nmodified Neuroevolution of Augmenting Topologies (NEAT) algorithm is employed\nto evolve the CPPNs such that they create metamaterial designs on the Pareto\nfront of the MOO problem, revealing empirical bounds of different combinations\nof elastic properties.

To tackle these challenges, we propose ECBench, a high-quality\nbenchmark designed to systematically evaluate the embodied cognitive abilities\nof LVLMs. ECBench features a diverse range of scene video sources, open and\nvaried question formats, and 30 dimensions of embodied cognition. To ensure\nquality, balance, and high visual dependence, ECBench uses class-independent\nmeticulous human annotation and multi-round question screening strategies.\nAdditionally, we introduce ECEval, a comprehensive evaluation system that\nensures the fairness and rationality of the indicators. Utilizing ECBench, we\nconduct extensive evaluations of proprietary, open-source, and task-specific\nLVLMs. ECBench is pivotal in advancing the embodied cognitive capabilities of\nLVLMs, laying a solid foundation for developing reliable core models for\nembodied agents.

Conventional two-equation RANS models (e.g., the $k$-$\\varepsilon$\nmodel) lack a clear criterion for incorporating unstable buoyancy effects in\ntheir scale-determining equations (e.g., $\\varepsilon$-equation). To address\nthis gap, a global correction function is introduced, derived from a\ngeneralized algebraic formulation that incorporates available potential energy\nas an additional parameter. This function reproduces a global similarity law\ncommonly observed in natural convection flows--for instance, the correlation\namong the Nusselt, Rayleigh, and Prandtl numbers, which can be approximately\nexpressed as a single power law over a wide parameter range. A calibration\nmethod is proposed in which an approximate analytical solution for\nRayleigh--B\\'enard convection is obtained via equilibrium analysis, confirming\nthat the proposed model captures similarity relations not addressed by\nconventional one-point closures. Numerical results show significantly improved\nagreement with experimental data, accurately reproducing Nusselt number\ndependencies over broad ranges of Rayleigh and Prandtl numbers in unstably\nstratified flows, such as Rayleigh--B\\'enard convection and two types of\ninternally heated convection. The method remains fully compatible with standard\nRANS frameworks and reverts to traditional turbulence treatments in\nshear-driven flows where buoyant effects are negligible. By introducing only a\nsingle, simple, algebraic global function in the conventional\n$\\varepsilon$-equation, this approach significantly enhances the accuracy and\nrobustness of buoyancy-driven turbulence simulations.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Wed, 22 Jan 2025 15:57:40 GMT"}, {"version": "v2", "created": "Tue, 11 Mar 2025 16:27:13 GMT"}, {"version": "v3", "created": "Wed, 12 Mar 2025 03:28:37 GMT"}, {"version": "v4", "created": "Thu, 13 Mar 2025 02:47:37 GMT"}], "update_date": "2025-03-14", "authors_parsed": [["Joo", "Da-Sol", ""]]}

We first explore conditions under which\nthese point-wise operators are well defined on H. Next, we determine conditions\nto ensure that the resulting coefficient functions satisfy local growth and\nLipschitz properties, so to guarantee the existence and uniqueness of mild\nsolutions. The proposed model captures the behavior of the entire forward curve\nthrough a single equation, yet retains remarkable simplicity.

The extended acquisition time\nwill further increase the susceptibility to motion artifacts. Existing deep\nlearning-based reconstruction methods have been proven to perform well in image\nreconstruction tasks, but most of them are designed for specific acquisition\nmodality or dedicated imaging parameter, which limits their ability to\ngeneralize across a variety of scan scenarios. To address this issue, the\nCMRxRecon2024 challenge consists of two specific tasks: Task 1 focuses on a\nmodality-universal setting, evaluating the out-of-distribution generalization\nof existing learning-based models, while Task 2 follows a k-space\nsampling-universal setting, assessing the all-in-one adaptability of universal\nmodels. Main contributions of this challenge include providing the largest\npublicly available multi-modality, multi-view cardiac k-space dataset; and\ndeveloping an open benchmarking platform for algorithm evaluation and shared\ncode library for data processing. In addition, through a detailed analysis of\nthe results submitted to the challenge, we have also made several findings,\nincluding: 1) adaptive prompt-learning embedding is an effective means for\nachieving strong generalization in reconstruction models; 2) enhanced data\nconsistency based on physics-informed networks is also an effective pathway\ntoward a universal model; 3) traditional evaluation metrics have limitations\nwhen assessing ground-truth references with moderate or lower image quality,\nhighlighting the need for subjective evaluation methods.

Drawing on public\nadministration theory and recent advances in AI capabilities, we analyze how\nthese dynamics could unfold through three key channels: the automation of\ndiscretionary decision-making within agencies, the evolution of bureaucratic\nstructures toward system-level architectures, and the transformation of\ndemocratic feedback mechanisms. Our analysis reveals specific failure modes\nthat could destabilize liberal institutions. Enhanced state capacity through\nAGI could enable unprecedented surveillance and control, potentially\nentrenching authoritarian practices. Conversely, rapid diffusion of AGI\ncapabilities to non-state actors could undermine state legitimacy and\ngovernability. We examine how these risks manifest differently at the micro\nlevel of individual bureaucratic decisions, the meso level of organizational\nstructure, and the macro level of democratic processes.

SIC causes\nthe system to behave the same at any length scale, from which many existing\nsampling methods suffer: long-range correlations cause critical slowing down in\nMarkov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC), and require intractably large receptive fields\nfor generative samplers. In this paper, we propose a Renormalization-informed\nGenerative Critical Sampler (RiGCS) -- a novel sampler specialized for\nnear-critical systems, where SIC is leveraged as an advantage rather than a\nnuisance. Specifically, RiGCS builds on MultiLevel Monte Carlo (MLMC) with Heat\nBath (HB) algorithms, which perform ancestral sampling from low-resolution to\nhigh-resolution lattice configurations with site-wise-independent conditional\nHB sampling. Although MLMC-HB is highly efficient under exact SIC, it suffers\nfrom a low acceptance rate under slight SIC violation. Notably, SIC violation\nalways occurs in finite-size systems, and may induce long-range and\nhigher-order interactions in the renormalized distributions, which are not\nconsidered by independent HB samplers. RiGCS enhances MLMC-HB by replacing a\npart of the conditional HB sampler with generative models that capture those\nresidual interactions and improve the sampling efficiency.

While large scale fault tolerant quantum (LSFTQ)\nmachines are not yet available, recent works on hybrid quantum machine learning\nmodels, compatible with noisy intermediate scale quantum (NISQ) computers, have\nhinted at improved generalizability.

Notably, we establish that Stochastic\nBalance achieves a competitiveness of at least $0.5796$ for the problem (under\nequal vanishing probabilities), improving upon the previous bound of $0.576$ by\nHuang and Zhang (STOC 2020). Meanwhile, our analysis yields an upper bound of\n$0.5810$ for a function space strictly larger than that considered in Huang and\nZhang (STOC 2020).\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Wed, 12 Mar 2025 16:18:11 GMT"}, {"version": "v2", "created": "Thu, 13 Mar 2025 15:53:34 GMT"}], "update_date": "2025-03-14", "authors_parsed": [["Xu", "Pan", ""]]}

Our investigation uncovers systematic patterns\nof model performance disparities linked to basin characteristics, the inherent\ncomplexity of biogeochemical processes, and variable predictability,\nemphasizing critical performance fairness concerns. We further propose\nmethodological frameworks for quantitatively evaluating critical aspects of\ntrustworthiness, including uncertainty, interpretability, and robustness,\nidentifying key limitations that could challenge reliable real-world\ndeployment. This work serves as a timely call to action for advancing\ntrustworthy data-driven methods for water resources management and provides a\npathway to offering critical insights for researchers, decision-makers, and\npractitioners seeking to leverage artificial intelligence (AI) responsibly in\nenvironmental management.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Thu, 13 Mar 2025 01:50:50 GMT"}], "update_date": "2025-03-14", "authors_parsed": [["Xia", "Xiaobo", ""], ["Liu", "Xiaofeng", ""], ["Liu", "Jiale", ""], ["Fang", "Kuai", ""], ["Lu", "Lu", ""], ["Oymak", "Samet", ""], ["Currie", "William S.", ""], ["Liu", "Tongliang", ""]]}

At the edge level, low-complexity DCT\ncompression units are designed using parallel trainable hard-thresholding and\nscaling operators to remove redundant data and extract the effective latent\nspace representation. At the fog level, an adaptive filter bank is applied to\nmerge important features from adjacent channels into each individual channel by\nleveraging inter-channel correlations. Then, the inverse DCT reconstructed\nmulti-head attention is developed to capture both local and global dependencies\nand reconstruct the original signals. Furthermore, by applying the principles\nof variational inference, a new evidence lower bound is formulated as the loss\nfunction, driving the model to balance compression efficiency and\nreconstruction accuracy.

Recent works handle this\nproblem by leveraging Multi-modal Large Language Models (MLLMs) to describe\npedestrian images automatically.

To address this issue, we propose a Human\nAnnotator Modeling (HAM) approach to enable MLLMs to mimic the description\nstyles of thousands of human annotators. Specifically, we first extract style\nfeatures from human textual descriptions and perform clustering on them. This\nallows us to group textual descriptions with similar styles into the same\ncluster. Then, we employ a prompt to represent each of these clusters and apply\nprompt learning to mimic the description styles of different human annotators.\nFurthermore, we define a style feature space and perform uniform sampling in\nthis space to obtain more diverse clustering prototypes, which further enriches\nthe diversity of the MLLM-generated captions.

Due to the unavailability of target-domain data,\nsome methods leverage the multimodal capabilities of vision-language models,\nusing textual prompts to estimate cross-domain information, enhancing the\nmodel's generalization capability.

To address this\nlimitation, we propose a new method, i.e., Style Evolving along\nChain-of-Thought, which aims to progressively integrate and expand style\ninformation along the chain of thought, enabling the continual evolution of\nstyles. Specifically, by progressively refining style descriptions and guiding\nthe diverse evolution of styles, this approach enables more accurate simulation\nof various style characteristics and helps the model gradually learn and adapt\nto subtle differences between styles.

This formulation leads\nto a set of four first-order equations that can be reduced to a second-order\nwave equation, enabling the analysis of gravitational effects on quantum\ninteractions. Two mass modifications are considered: (i) \\(m \\rightarrow m -\na/r\\), representing an attractive Coulomb interaction, and (ii) \\(m \\rightarrow\nm - a/r + b r\\), corresponding to a Cornell potential. For case (i), an exact\nanalytical solution is obtained, while for case (ii), conditionally exact\nsolutions involving biconfluent Heun functions are derived.

Traditional\nmotion planning finds collision-free paths, but this is overly restrictive in\nclutter, where it may not be possible for a robot to accomplish a task without\ncontact. In addition, contacts range from relatively benign (e.g., brushing a\nsoft pillow) to more dangerous (e.g., toppling a glass vase). Due to this\ndiversity, it is difficult to characterize which contacts may be acceptable or\nunacceptable. In this paper, we propose IMPACT, a novel motion planning\nframework that uses Vision-Language Models (VLMs) to infer environment\nsemantics, identifying which parts of the environment can best tolerate contact\nbased on object properties and locations. Our approach uses the VLM's outputs\nto produce a dense 3D \"cost map\" that encodes contact tolerances and seamlessly\nintegrates with standard motion planners. We perform experiments using 20\nsimulation and 10 real-world scenes and assess using task success rate, object\ndisplacements, and feedback from human evaluators.

While dust halos can readily be modeled as spin-modulated activity\noriginating from the comet nucleus, their possible connection to those dark\nlinear features has, to our knowledge, not been investigated.

To model the dust features, we employed a Monte Carlo procedure to\ngenerate synthetic images. The particles ejected from the comet nucleus follow\na power-law size distribution and are released into interplanetary space at\nspeeds determined by the ratio of solar radiation pressure to solar gravity,\nthe heliocentric distance, and, as a new feature of the code, the solar zenith\nangle at the emission point.\n  Results.

We systematically address this by recasting\nthe two-trials rule and meta-analysis in a unified framework of combined\np-value functions, where they are variants of Wilkinson's and Stouffer's\ncombination methods, respectively.

When both trials have the\nsame true effect, all methods can consistently estimate it, although some show\nbias. When true effects differ, the two-trials rule and Pearson's method are\nconservative (converging to the less extreme effect), Fisher's and Tippett's\nmethods are anti-conservative (converging to the more extreme effect), and\nEdgington's method and meta-analysis are balanced (converging to a weighted\naverage).

This\neffect can occur not only in itinerant electron systems but also in localized\nelectron systems that emerge due to electronic correlations. In such systems,\nelementary excitations behaving as bosons govern spin transport, and magnetic\ninteractions originating from spin-orbit coupling can induce a topologically\nnontrivial band structure. However, such magnetic interactions can potentially\nbreak spin conservation, thereby preventing conventional spin currents from\nbeing conserved. In this study, starting from a general localized electron\nmodel, we formulate the spin Nernst effect in terms of a conserved spin current\nthat remains applicable even in spin-nonconserving systems. To address the\ntorque term appearing in the conserved spin current, we adopt semiclassical\ntheory and derive an expression for the spin Nernst coefficient for bosonic\nsystems. This coefficient consists of two terms originating from the Berry\ncurvature and the quantum metric, which are distinctly different from the spin\nBerry curvature obtained in an approach that neglects the torque term. We apply\nour framework to two specific quantum spin models, the Kitaev-Heisenberg and\nShastry-Sutherland models, and calculate the temperature dependence of the spin\nNernst coefficient. We find that this quantity significantly differs from that\nobtained by neglecting the torque term in both models.

First, we develop a new method that estimates the\n6D pose of any object in the input image without prior knowledge of the object\nitself.

The extracted object trajectories are then\nretargeted via trajectory optimization into the configuration space of a\nrobotic manipulator. Third, we thoroughly evaluate and ablate our 6D pose\nestimation method on YCB-V and HOPE-Video datasets as well as a new dataset of\ninstructional videos manually annotated with approximate 6D object\ntrajectories. We demonstrate significant improvements over existing\nstate-of-the-art RGB 6D pose estimation methods.

Certain ultralight bosons, such as axions and\naxion-like particles (promising dark matter candidates), naturally possess\nself-interactions, and thus may significantly modify the dynamics of the\nsuperradiance process. Previous studies on the detection or constraint of\nultralight bosons through superradiance have largely neglected the\nself-interaction effects of bosons. In this work, we investigate the formation\nand evolution of self-interacting boson clouds in the full Kerr spacetime\nduring BH superradiance. Using numerical methods, we compute the superradiant\ngrowth rate of boson clouds with self-interactions around Kerr BHs and\nquantitatively evaluate how the self-interaction strength of scalar bosons\naffects the growth rate. We also assess the evolution of the BH's mass and\nspin. Our results reveal that, in addition to the superradiance-imposed upper\nbound on the boson cloud mass, self-interactions of ultralight bosons introduce\na new, lower critical mass limit, beyond which the growth rate of the boson\ncloud approaches zero. This implies that the superradiance process terminates\nearlier when self-interactions are considered. Furthermore, we explore how\nself-interactions affect both the oscillation frequency of boson clouds in\ngravitational atoms and the frequency of gravitational wave (GW) emitted\nthrough cloud annihilation. The anticipated frequency shift could be detectable\nby the GW observatories. Given that self-interactions substantially alter the\nevolution of BH superradiance, their effects can significantly relax existing\nconstraints on scalar boson models derived from superradiance.

We identify\nthree foundational shifts: 1) contextual coherence, where LRMs resolve\nambiguities and preserve discourse structure through explicit reasoning over\ncross-sentence and complex context or even lack of context; 2) cultural\nintentionality, enabling models to adapt outputs by inferring speaker intent,\naudience expectations, and socio-linguistic norms; 3) self-reflection, LRMs can\nperform self-reflection during the inference time to correct the potential\nerrors in translation especially extremely noisy cases, showing better\nrobustness compared to simply mapping X->Y translation.

To address these limitations, the\nimplementation of automated pre-screening and analysis systems for EEG data\nholds considerable promise. Advances in self-supervised learning made it\npossible to pre-train complex deep learning architectures on large volumes of\nunlabeled EEG data to learn generalizable representations, that can later be\nused to enhance performance on multiple tasks while needing less downstream\ndata. In the present paper, we introduce BioSerenity-E1, the first of a family\nof self-supervised foundation models for clinical EEG applications that\ncombines spectral tokenization with masked prediction to achieve\nstate-of-the-art performance across relevant diagnostic tasks. The two-phase\nself-supervised pretraining framework initially acquires compressed EEG\nrepresentations via a transformer-based VQ-VAE architecture designed to\nreconstruct log-multitaper spectral projections, then implements extensive (70%\nblock) masked token prediction to force the model to learn complex\nspatiotemporal dependencies in EEG signals. BioSerenity-E1 achieves strong\nperformance across three clinical tasks, either in line or above\nstate-of-the-art methods: seizure detection (AUROC = 0.926, Sensitivity =\n0.909), normal/abnormal classification (AUPRC = 0.970 on proprietary data;\n0.910 on TUH-Abnormal), and multiclass pathology differentiation on unbalanced\ndata (Weighted F1 = 0.730).

For\nexample, Dirac surface states with helical spin- and orbital-angular momenta\nare a hallmark of a 3D topological insulator. Angle-resolved photoemission\nspectroscopy (ARPES) with variable circular light polarization, known as\ncircular dichroism (CD), has been assumed to be a direct probe of OAM and, by\nproxy, of the Berry curvature of electronic bands in energy- and\nmomentum-space. Indeed, topological surface states have been shown to exhibit\nangle-dependent CD (CDAD), and more broadly, CD is often interpreted as\nevidence of spin-orbit coupling. Meanwhile, it is well-established that CD\noriginates from the photoemission matrix elements, which can have extrinsic\ncontributions related to the experimental geometry and the inherently broken\ninversion symmetry at the sample surface. Therefore, it is important to broadly\nexamine CD-ARPES to determine the scenarios in which it provides a robust probe\nof intrinsic material physics. We performed CD-ARPES on the canonical\ntopological insulator $\\mathrm{Bi}_2\\mathrm{Se}_3$ over a wide range of\nincident photon energies. Not only do we observe angle-dependent CD in the\nsurface states, as expected, but we also find CD of a similar magnitude in\nvirtually all bulk bands.

Comparison with theoretical calculations supports this view and\nsuggests that $\\textit{hidden}$ OAM - localized to atomic sites within each\nunit cell - contributes significantly. Additional effects, including\ninter-atomic interference and final-state resonances, are responsible for the\nrapid variation of the CDAD signal with photon energy.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Thu, 13 Mar 2025 14:07:07 GMT"}], "update_date": "2025-03-14", "authors_parsed": [["Sidilkover", "Ittai", ""], ["Yen", "Yun", ""], ["D'Souza", "Sunil Wilfred", ""], ["Schusser", "Jakub", ""], ["Pulkkinen", "Aki", ""], ["Rotundu", "Costel R.", ""], ["Hashimoto", "Makoto", ""], ["Liu", "Donghui", ""], ["Shen", "Zhi-Xun", ""], ["Min\u00e1r", "J\u00e1n", ""], ["Sch\u00fcler", "Michael", ""], ["Soifer", "Hadas", ""], ["Sobota", "Jonathan A.", ""]]}

This work expands on a recent survey called \"Protostellar\nOutflows at the EarliesT Stages\" (POETS), which has been devoted to studying\nyoung outflow emission on scales of 10-100 au near luminous YSOs, before they\nstart photoionizing the surrounding medium. We carried out multi-epoch Very\nLong Baseline Array observations of the 22 GHz water masers toward NGC7538 IRS1\nto measure the maser 3D velocities, which, following POETS' findings, are\nreliable tracers of the protostellar winds. Recently, we reobserved the water\nmasers in NGC7538 IRS1 with sensitive global very long baseline interferometry\n(VLBI) observations to map weaker maser emission. Our study confirms the\npresence of two embedded YSOs, IRS1a and IRS1b, at the center of the two linear\ndistributions of 6.7 GHz methanol masers observed in the southern and northern\ncores of the HC HII region, which have been previously interpreted in terms of\nedge-on rotating disks. The water masers trace an extended (~200 au) stationary\nshock front adjacent to the inner portion of the disk around IRS1a. This shock\nfront corresponds to the edge of the southern tip of the ionized core and might\nbe produced by the interaction of the disk wind ejected from IRS1a with the\ninfalling envelope. The water masers closer to IRS1b follow the same LSR\nvelocity (Vlsr) pattern of the 6.7~GHz masers rotating in the disk, but the\ndirection and amplitude of the water maser proper motions are inconsistent with\nrotation. We propose that these water masers are tracing a photo-evaporated\ndisk wind, where the maser Vlsr traces mainly the disk rotation and the proper\nmotions the poloidal velocity of the wind.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Thu, 13 Mar 2025 14:36:29 GMT"}], "update_date": "2025-03-14", "authors_parsed": [["Moscadelli", "Luca", ""], ["Goddi", "Ciriaco", ""], ["Hirota", "Tomoya", ""], ["Sanna", "Alberto", ""]]}

The goal of\nSubset-FAST is to determine whether there is an arc set $S \\subseteq A(D)$ of\nsize at most $k$ whose removal ensures that no directed cycle passes through\nany terminal in $T$. Prior to our work, no polynomial kernel for Subset-FAST\nwas known. In our work, we show that Subset-FAST admits an $\\mathcal{O}((\\alpha\nk)^{2})$-vertex kernel, provided that Subset-FAST has an approximation\nalgorithm with an approximation ratio $\\alpha$. Consequently, based on the\nknown $\\mathcal{O}(\\log k \\log \\log k)$-approximation algorithm, we obtain an\nalmost quadratic kernel for Subset-FAST.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Thu, 13 Mar 2025 15:11:45 GMT"}], "update_date": "2025-03-14", "authors_parsed": [["Bai", "Tian", ""]]}

Interpretation of these\narbitrary constants and functions as some physical quantities that can in\nprinciple be measured is a non-trivial matter. Concentrating on the case of\nconstants, one usually identifies them as conserved mass, momentum, angular\nmomentum, center of mass, or some other hairs of the solution. This can be done\nvia the Arnowitt-Deser-Misner (ADM)-type construction based on pure geometry;\nand the solution is typically a black hole.

This becomes quite important especially\nwhen there is a cosmological constant. Secondly, one usually assigns the\nmaximally symmetric spacetime, say the flat or the (anti)-de Sitter spacetime,\nto have a zero mass and angular momentum and linear momentum. This declares the\nmaximally symmetric spacetime to be the vacuum of the theory, but such an\nassignment depends on the coordinates in the ADM-type constructions and their\nextensions: in fact, one can introduce large gauge transformations (new\ncoordinates) which map, say, the flat spacetime to flat spacetime but the\nresultant flat spacetime can have a nontrivial mass and angular momentum, if\nthe new coordinates are such that the metric components do not decay properly.\nThese issues, which are often overlooked, will be examined in detail, and a\nresolution, via the use of a divergence-free rank $(0,4)$-tensor will be shown\nfor the case of anti-de Sitter spacetimes.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Thu, 13 Mar 2025 15:19:58 GMT"}], "update_date": "2025-03-14", "authors_parsed": [["Ogurol", "Leyla", ""], ["Tekin", "Bayram", ""]]}

Often, eavesdroppers can accumulate sufficient information\ntransmitted in sidelobes by integrating over long enough periods. Directional\nmodulation (DM) disrupts this capability by inducing a randomized walk through\nIQ-space to reach a pertinent location which corresponds to a symbol of\nparticular amplitude and phase. This results in higher secrecy capacity. The\npath taken by the cumulative element contributions are determined by the\ncomplex weights of individual transmitters. Because large phased arrays support\na large number of available paths, repetitions of applied weights are not\nconcerning. The same cannot be said for arrays that consist of only a few\nelements, e.g. WiFi routers. We introduce a computationally efficient and\nflexible framework for DM that utilizes real-valued phase rotations of element\nweights. It supports a wide family of modulation schemes in phase and/or\namplitude. Using state-of-the-practice orthogonal noise injection framework, we\ndemonstrate a richness of unique paths resolving concerns about repeated\nweights. In our proposed scheme, there is a small reduction in received power\ncompared to traditional beamforming, as little as 1 dB, which is an advantage\nover conventional directional modulation which typically sacrifices 6 dB of\npower. Also, there is a significantly larger set of possible element weights\nthan that of the conventional scheme. This feature protects against the\npossibility of eavesdroppers breaking the distortion-based obfuscation of\nsymbols over repeated observations.

The minimal nature of this task means only a single choice needs to be\nmade: which of the $D$ arms contains $t$?\n  Decoder-only LMs fail to solve this elementary task above $1/D$ chance due to\na learned shortcut that absorbs training supervision.

In this\npaper, we introduce HybridVLA, a unified framework that seamlessly integrates\nthe strengths of both autoregressive and diffusion policies within a single\nlarge language model, rather than simply connecting them. To bridge the\ngeneration gap, a collaborative training recipe is proposed that injects the\ndiffusion modeling directly into the next-token prediction. With this recipe,\nwe find that these two forms of action prediction not only reinforce each other\nbut also exhibit varying performance across different tasks. Therefore, we\ndesign a collaborative action ensemble mechanism that adaptively fuses these\ntwo predictions, leading to more robust control. In experiments, HybridVLA\noutperforms previous state-of-the-art VLA methods across various simulation and\nreal-world tasks, including both single-arm and dual-arm robots, while\ndemonstrating stable manipulation in previously unseen configurations.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Thu, 13 Mar 2025 17:59:52 GMT"}], "update_date": "2025-03-14", "authors_parsed": [["Liu", "Jiaming", ""], ["Chen", "Hao", ""], ["An", "Pengju", ""], ["Liu", "Zhuoyang", ""], ["Zhang", "Renrui", ""], ["Gu", "Chenyang", ""], ["Li", "Xiaoqi", ""], ["Guo", "Ziyu", ""], ["Chen", "Sixiang", ""], ["Liu", "Mengzhen", ""], ["Hou", "Chengkai", ""], ["Zhao", "Mengdi", ""], ["Zhou", "KC alex", ""], ["Heng", "Pheng-Ann", ""], ["Zhang", "Shanghang", ""]]}

This critical\nabsence of semantic information leads commercial LVLMs to either ignore the\nperturbation entirely or misinterpret its embedded semantics, thereby causing\nthe attack to fail. To overcome these issues, we notice that identifying core\nsemantic objects is a key objective for models trained with various datasets\nand methodologies. This insight motivates our approach that refines semantic\nclarity by encoding explicit semantic details within local regions, thus\nensuring interoperability and capturing finer-grained features, and by\nconcentrating modifications on semantically rich areas rather than applying\nthem uniformly. To achieve this, we propose a simple yet highly effective\nsolution: at each optimization step, the adversarial image is cropped randomly\nby a controlled aspect ratio and scale, resized, and then aligned with the\ntarget image in the embedding space. Experimental results confirm our\nhypothesis.
