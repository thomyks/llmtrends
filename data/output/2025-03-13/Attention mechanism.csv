but presents challenges. Effective models must capture both spatial and
temporal dependencies in the data, while also incorporating auxiliary
information to enhance prediction accuracy. In this paper, we identify
limitations in current state-of-the-art models regarding temporal dependency
handling. To overcome this, we introduce GSA-Forecaster, a new deep learning
model designed for forecasting in graph-based, time-dependent contexts.
GSA-Forecaster utilizes graph sequence attention, a new attention mechanism
proposed in this paper, to effectively manage temporal dependencies.
GSA-Forecaster integrates the data's graph structure directly into its
architecture, addressing spatial dependencies. Additionally, it incorporates
auxiliary information to refine its predictions further. We validate its
performance using real-world graph-based, time-dependent datasets, where it
demonstrates superior effectiveness compared to existing state-of-the-art
models.

vision community in recent years. However, the core component of ViT,
Self-Attention, lacks explicit spatial priors and bears a quadratic
computational complexity, thereby constraining the applicability of ViT. To
alleviate these issues, we draw inspiration from the recent Retentive Network
(RetNet) in the field of NLP, and propose RMT, a strong vision backbone with
explicit spatial prior for general purposes. Specifically, we extend the
RetNet's temporal decay mechanism to the spatial domain, and propose a spatial
decay matrix based on the Manhattan distance to introduce the explicit spatial
prior to Self-Attention. Additionally, an attention decomposition form that
adeptly adapts to explicit spatial prior is proposed, aiming to reduce the
computational burden of modeling global information without disrupting the
spatial decay matrix. Based on the spatial decay matrix and the attention
decomposition form, we can flexibly integrate explicit spatial prior into the
vision backbone with linear complexity. Extensive experiments demonstrate that
RMT exhibits exceptional performance across various vision tasks. Specifically,
without extra training data, RMT achieves **84.8%** and **86.1%** top-1 acc on
ImageNet-1k with **27M/4.5GFLOPs** and **96M/18.2GFLOPs**. For downstream

text-conditional diffusion models. Empirical observations suggest that
cross-attention outputs converge to a fixed point after several inference
steps. The convergence time naturally divides the entire inference process into
two phases: an initial phase for planning text-oriented visual semantics, which
are then translated into images in a subsequent fidelity-improving phase.
Cross-attention is essential in the initial phase but almost irrelevant
thereafter. However, self-attention initially plays a minor role but becomes
crucial in the second phase. These findings yield a simple and training-free
method known as temporally gating the attention (TGATE), which efficiently
generates images by caching and reusing attention outputs at scheduled time
steps. Experimental results show when widely applied to various existing
text-conditional diffusion models, TGATE accelerates these models by 10%-50%.

for timely assessments providing assistance to speech language pathologists.
Despite notable advancements in the field, the cases in which multiple
disfluencies occur in speech require attention. We have taken a progressive
approach to fill this gap by classifying multi-stuttered speech more
efficiently. The problem has been addressed by firstly curating a dataset of
multi-stuttered disfluencies from open source dataset SEP-28k audio clips.
Secondly, employing Whisper, a state-of-the-art speech recognition model has
been leveraged by using its encoder and taking the problem as multi label
classification. Thirdly, using a 6 encoder layer Whisper and experimenting with
various layer freezing strategies, a computationally efficient configuration of
the model was identified. The proposed configuration achieved micro, macro, and
weighted F1-scores of 0.88, 0.85, and 0.87, correspondingly on an external test
dataset i.e. Fluency-Bank. In addition, through layer freezing strategies, we
were able to achieve the aforementioned results by fine-tuning a single encoder
layer, consequently, reducing the model's trainable parameters from 20.27
million to 3.29 million. This research study unveils the contribution of the
last encoder layer in the identification of disfluencies in stuttered speech.
Consequently, it has led to a computationally efficient approach, 83.7% less

optimization. We thus introduce a novel backpropagation-free PTQ algorithm that
optimizes integer weights by considering inter-layer dependencies. The key
innovation is the development of attention-aware Hessian matrices that capture
inter-layer interactions within the attention module. Extensive experiments

in solving a variety of hard combinatorial optimization problems (COPs).
However, they generally rely on a separate neural model, specialized and

of its model and re-training from scratch. In this paper, we propose GOAL (for
Generalist combinatorial Optimization Agent Learner), a generalist model
capable of efficiently solving multiple COPs and which can be fine-tuned to
solve new COPs. GOAL consists of a single backbone plus light-weight
problem-specific adapters for input and output processing. The backbone is
based on a new form of mixed-attention blocks which allows to handle problems
defined on graphs with arbitrary combinations of node, edge and instance-level
features. Additionally, problems which involve heterogeneous types of nodes or
edges are handled through a novel multi-type transformer architecture, where
the attention blocks are duplicated to attend the meaningful combinations of
types while relying on the same shared parameters. We train GOAL on a set of
routing, scheduling and classic graph problems and show that it is only
slightly inferior to the specialized baselines while being the first multi-task
model that solves a wide range of COPs. Finally we showcase the strong transfer

to handle multiple types of degradation with a single model. The primary
challenge is to extract degradation representations from the input degraded
images and use them to guide the model's adaptation to specific degradation
types. Building on the insight that various degradations affect image content
differently across frequency bands, we propose a new dual-transformer approach
comprising two components: a frequency-aware Degradation estimation transformer
(Dformer) and a degradation-adaptive Restoration transformer (Rformer). The
Dformer captures the essential characteristics of various degradations by
decomposing the input into different frequency components. By understanding how
degradations affect these frequency components, the Dformer learns robust
priors that effectively guide the restoration process. The Rformer then employs
a degradation-adaptive self-attention module to selectively focus on the most
affected frequency components, guided by the learned degradation
representations. Extensive experimental results demonstrate that our approach
outperforms existing methods in five representative restoration tasks,
including denoising, deraining, dehazing, deblurring, and low-light
enhancement. Additionally, our method offers benefits for handling, real-world
degradations, spatially variant degradations, and unseen degradation levels.

Feature disentanglement (FD)-based methods, aiming at learning superior feature
representations for multimodal data analysis, have achieved significant success
in multimodal learning (MML). Typically, existing FD-based methods separate
multimodal data into modality-shared and modality-specific features, and employ
concatenation or attention mechanisms to integrate these features. However, our
preliminary experiments indicate that these methods could lead to a loss of
shared information among subsets of modalities when the inputs contain more
than two modalities, and such information is critical for prediction accuracy.
Furthermore, these methods do not adequately interpret the relationships
between the decoupled features at the fusion stage. To address these
limitations, we propose a novel Complete Feature Disentanglement (CFD) strategy
that recovers the lost information during feature decoupling. Specifically, the
CFD strategy not only identifies modality-shared and modality-specific
features, but also decouples shared features among subsets of multimodal
inputs, termed as modality-partial-shared features. We further introduce a new
Dynamic Mixture-of-Experts Fusion (DMF) module that dynamically integrates
these decoupled features, by explicitly learning the local-global relationships
among the features. The effectiveness of our approach is validated through
classification tasks on three multimodal MRI datasets. Extensive experimental

methods with obvious margins, showcasing its superior performance.

  networks","This is the extended version of a paper accepted to AAAI 2025, AI for
  Social Impact Track (oral)",,,,cs.LG cs.CY cs.SI,http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/,"  The global economy relies on the flow of goods over supply chain networks,
with nodes as firms and edges as transactions between firms. While we may
observe these external transactions, they are governed by unseen production
functions, which determine how firms internally transform the input products
they receive into output products that they sell. In this setting, it can be
extremely valuable to infer these production functions, to improve supply chain
visibility and to forecast future transactions more accurately. However,
existing graph neural networks (GNNs) cannot capture these hidden relationships
between nodes' inputs and outputs. Here, we introduce a new class of models for
this setting by combining temporal GNNs with a novel inventory module, which
learns production functions via attention weights and a special loss function.
We evaluate our models extensively on real supply chains data and data
generated from our new open-source simulator, SupplySim. Our models
successfully infer production functions, outperforming the strongest baseline
by 6%-50% (across datasets), and forecast future transactions, outperforming
the strongest baseline by 11%-62%

  Network",,,,,cs.CV eess.IV,http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/,"  The Quick-view (QV) technique serves as a primary method for detecting
defects within sewerage systems. However, the effectiveness of QV is impeded by
the limited visual range of its hardware, resulting in suboptimal image quality
for distant portions of the sewer network. Image super-resolution is an
effective way to improve image quality and has been applied in a variety of
scenes. However, research on super-resolution for sewer images remains
considerably unexplored. In response, this study leverages the inherent depth
relationships present within QV images and introduces a novel Depth-guided,
Reference-based Super-Resolution framework denoted as DSRNet. It comprises two
core components: a depth extraction module and a depth information matching
module (DMM). DSRNet utilizes the adjacent frames of the low-resolution image
as reference images and helps them recover texture information based on the
correlation. By combining these modules, the integration of depth priors
significantly enhances both visual quality and performance benchmarks. Besides,
in pursuit of computational efficiency and compactness, a super-resolution
knowledge distillation model based on an attention mechanism is introduced.
This mechanism facilitates the acquisition of feature similarity between a more
complex teacher model and a streamlined student model, with the latter being a
lightweight version of DSRNet. Experimental results demonstrate that DSRNet
significantly improves PSNR and SSIM compared with other methods. This study
also conducts experiments on sewer defect semantic segmentation, object
detection, and classification on the Pipe dataset and Sewer-ML dataset.
Experiments show that the method can improve the performance of low-resolution
sewer images in these tasks.

  Integration and Semantic-Aligned Quality Transfer",,,,,cs.CV eess.IV,http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/,"  Accurate measurement of image quality without reference signals remains a
fundamental challenge in low-level visual perception applications. In this
paper, we propose a global-local progressive integration model that addresses
this challenge through three key contributions: 1) We develop a
dual-measurement framework that combines vision Transformer (ViT)-based global
feature extractor and convolutional neural networks (CNNs)-based local feature
extractor to comprehensively capture and quantify image distortion
characteristics at different granularities. 2) We propose a progressive feature
integration scheme that utilizes multi-scale kernel configurations to align
global and local features, and progressively aggregates them via an interactive
stack of channel-wise self-attention and spatial interaction modules for
multi-grained quality-aware representations. 3) We introduce a semantic-aligned
quality transfer method that extends the training data by automatically
labeling the quality scores of diverse image content with subjective opinion
scores. Experimental results demonstrate that our model yields 5.04% and 5.40%
improvements in Spearman's rank-order correlation coefficient (SROCC) for
cross-authentic and cross-synthetic dataset generalization tests, respectively.
Furthermore, the proposed semantic-aligned quality transfer further yields
2.26% and 13.23% performance gains in evaluations on single-synthetic and
cross-synthetic datasets.

training-free approach for DiT-based video generation. Our method is founded on
the observation that attention difference in the diffusion process exhibits a
U-shaped pattern, indicating significant redundancy. We mitigate this by
broadcasting attention outputs to subsequent steps in a pyramid style. It
applies different broadcast strategies to each attention based on their
variance for best efficiency. We further introduce broadcast sequence parallel
for more efficient distributed inference. PAB demonstrates up to 10.5x speedup
across three models compared to baselines, achieving real-time generation for
up to 720p videos. We anticipate that our simple yet effective method will
serve as a robust baseline and facilitate future research and application for
video generation.
