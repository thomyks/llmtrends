1804.10646,Ben Webster,Michael McBreen and Ben Webster,Homological Mirror Symmetry for Hypertoric Varieties I,41 pages. v4: Final published version,Geom. Topol. 28 (2024) 1005-1063,10.2140/gt.2024.28.1005,,math.AG math.RT math.SG,http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/,"  We consider homological mirror symmetry in the context of hypertoric
varieties, showing that appropriate categories of B-branes (that is, coherent
sheaves) on an additive hypertoric variety match a category of A-branes on a
Dolbeault hypertoric manifold for the same underlying combinatorial data. For
technical reasons, the category of A-branes we consider is the modules over a
deformation quantization (that is, DQ-modules). We consider objects in this
category equipped with an analogue of a Hodge structure, which corresponds to a
$\mathbb{G}_m$-action on the dual side of the mirror symmetry.
  This result is based on hands-on calculations in both categories. We analyze
coherent sheaves by constructing a tilting generator, using the characteristic
$p$ approach of Kaledin; the result is a sum of line bundles, which can be
described using a simple combinatorial rule. The endomorphism algebra $H$ of
this tilting generator has a simple quadratic presentation in the grading
induced by $\mathbb{G}_m$-equivariance. In fact, we can confirm it is Koszul,
and compute its Koszul dual $H^!$.
  We then show that this same algebra appears as an Ext-algebra of simple
A-branes in a Dolbeault hypertoric manifold. The $\mathbb{G}_m$-equivariant
grading on coherent sheaves matches a Hodge grading in this category.

consumption of multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) receivers in large
bandwidth millimeter-wave systems. Prior works have considered two mitigating
solutions to reduce the ADC power consumption: i) decreasing the number of ADCs
via analog and hybrid beamforming, and ii) decreasing the ADC resolution, i.e.,
utilizing one-bit and few-bit ADCs. These mitigating solutions lead to
performance loss in terms of achievable rates due to increased quantization
error. In this work, the use of nonlinear analog operators such as envelope
detectors and polynomial operators, prior to sampling and quantization is
considered, as a way to reduce the aforementioned rate-loss. The receiver
architecture consists of linear combiners, nonlinear analog operators, and
few-bit ADCs. The fundamental performance limits of the resulting communication
system, in terms of achievable rates, are investigated under various
assumptions on the set of implementable analog operators. Extensive numerical
evaluations are provided to evaluate the set of achievable rates and the power
consumption of the proposed receiver architectures. Circuit simulations and
measurement results, based on both 22 nm FDSOI CMOS technology and 65 nm Bulk
CMOS transistor technologies, are provided to justify the power efficiency of
the proposed receiver architectures.

discoveries in natural sciences. Today, AI has started to advance natural
sciences by improving, accelerating, and enabling our understanding of natural
phenomena at a wide range of spatial and temporal scales, giving rise to a new
area of research known as AI for science (AI4Science). Being an emerging
research paradigm, AI4Science is unique in that it is an enormous and highly
interdisciplinary area. Thus, a unified and technical treatment of this field
is needed yet challenging. This work aims to provide a technically thorough
account of a subarea of AI4Science; namely, AI for quantum, atomistic, and
continuum systems. These areas aim at understanding the physical world from the
subatomic (wavefunctions and electron density), atomic (molecules, proteins,
materials, and interactions), to macro (fluids, climate, and subsurface) scales
and form an important subarea of AI4Science. A unique advantage of focusing on
these areas is that they largely share a common set of challenges, thereby
allowing a unified and foundational treatment. A key common challenge is how to
capture physics first principles, especially symmetries, in natural systems by
deep learning methods. We provide an in-depth yet intuitive account of
techniques to achieve equivariance to symmetry transformations. We also discuss
other common technical challenges, including explainability,
out-of-distribution generalization, knowledge transfer with foundation and
large language models, and uncertainty quantification. To facilitate learning
and education, we provide categorized lists of resources that we found to be
useful. We strive to be thorough and unified and hope this initial effort may
trigger more community interests and efforts to further advance AI4Science.

  Chen, Yehui Tang, Zhiwei Xiong, Baoqun Yin, Yunhe Wang",CBQ: Cross-Block Quantization for Large Language Models,,,,,cs.LG cs.CL,http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/,"  Post-training quantization (PTQ) has played a key role in compressing large
language models (LLMs) with ultra-low costs. However, existing PTQ methods only
focus on handling the outliers within one layer or one block, which ignores the
dependency of blocks and leads to severe performance degradation in low-bit
settings. In this paper, we propose CBQ, a cross-block reconstruction-based PTQ
method for LLMs. CBQ employs a cross-block dependency using a homologous
reconstruction scheme, establishing long-range dependencies across multiple
blocks to minimize error accumulation. Furthermore, CBQ incorporates a
coarse-to-fine preprocessing (CFP) strategy for suppressing weight and
activation outliers, coupled with an adaptive LoRA-Rounding technique for
precise weight quantization. These innovations enable CBQ to not only handle
extreme outliers effectively but also improve overall quantization accuracy.
Extensive experiments show that CBQ achieves superior low-bit quantization
(W4A4, W4A8, W2A16) and outperforms existing state-of-the-art methods across
various LLMs and datasets. Notably, CBQ quantizes the 4-bit LLAMA1-65B model
within only 4.3 hours on a single GPU, achieving a commendable tradeoff between
performance and quantization efficiency.

convolutional, linear, and transformer networks in the presence of quantized

utilizing quantized weights and activations and suitable mappings can

feedback bit allocation for the downlink of a cell-free massive MIMO (CF-mMIMO)
system, operating under limited feedback constraints. In CF-mMIMO systems
employing frequency division duplexing, each access point (AP) relies on
channel information provided by its associated user equipments (UEs) for
beamforming design. Since the uplink control channel is typically shared among
UEs, we take account of each AP's total feedback budget, which is distributed
among its associated UEs. By employing the Saleh-Valenzuela multi-resolvable
path channel model with different average path gains, we first identify
necessary feedback information for each UE, along with an appropriate codebook
structure. This structure facilitates adaptive quantization of multiple paths
based on their dominance. We then formulate a joint optimization problem
addressing user-centric UE-AP association and feedback bit allocation. To
address this challenge, we analyze the impact of feedback bit allocation and
derive our proposed scheme from the solution of an alternative optimization
problem aimed at devising long-term policies, explicitly considering the
effects of feedback bit allocation. Numerical results show that our proposed

of large language models. It increases the number of parameters while keeping
FLOPs nearly constant during inference through sparse activation. Yet, it still
suffers from significant memory overheads due to the vast parameter size,
necessitating model compression techniques. Post-training quantization offers a
powerful approach for model compression. Existing methods adopt a fixed
quantization precision for the entire MoE model. This rigid setup can lead to
suboptimal performance, without considering the inherent sparse structure. For
example, MoE's sparse routing mechanism leads to different activation patterns,
where shared experts are accessed by all tokens while token-conditioned experts
are selectively activated. This activation disparity suggests different
quantization requirements, with consistently activated shared experts
potentially needing higher precision to maintain model quality. In this paper,
we study a fine-grained precision setup for MoE quantization. We explore MoE
structure-aware quantization heuristics, ranging from coarse (e.g., MoE layers)
to fine granularity (e.g., linear layers). Our investigations reveal critical
principles, where different MoE structures require varying numbers of bits for
effective quantization. Conclusions are supported by extensive benchmarking
across two representative MoE models and six tasks including commonsense
reasoning and natural language understanding. We further show that an MoE
quantized in a fined-grained mixed precision achieved state-of-the-art 65.35%
performance on average compared to the baseline 64.30% (i.e., GPTQ). Moreover,
based on the findings, we introduce novel data-driven techniques for optimizing
bit allocation in MoE quantization, including the outlier-aware linear layer
scorer and MoE block importance predictor.

Leukemia (AML), a type of cancer that affects the blood and bone marrow, is
essential in the prognosis and follow-up of AML patients. As traditional
cytological analysis cannot detect leukemia cells below 5\%, the analysis of
flow cytometry dataset is expected to provide more reliable results. In this
paper, we explore statistical learning methods based on optimal transport (OT)
to achieve a relevant low-dimensional representation of multi-patient flow
cytometry measurements (FCM) datasets considered as high-dimensional
probability distributions. Using the framework of OT, we justify the use of the
K-means algorithm for dimensionality reduction of multiple large-scale point
clouds through mean measure quantization by merging all the data into a single
point cloud. After this quantization step, the visualization of the intra and
inter-patients FCM variability is carried out by embedding low-dimensional
quantized probability measures into a linear space using either Wasserstein
Principal Component Analysis (PCA) through linearized OT or log-ratio PCA of
compositional data. Using a publicly available FCM dataset and a FCM dataset
from Bordeaux University Hospital, we demonstrate the benefits of our approach
over the popular kernel mean embedding technique for statistical learning from
multiple high-dimensional probability distributions. We also highlight the
usefulness of our methodology for low-dimensional projection and clustering
patient measurements according to their level of MRD in AML from FCM. In
particular, our OT-based approach allows a relevant and informative
two-dimensional representation of the results of the FlowSom algorithm, a

initially developped for classical optical communications. It consists in
mixing the unknown field with a strong monochromatic local oscillator on an
unbalanced beamsplitter. A single output of the beamsplitter undergoes a direct
detection of the optical intensity by means of a single photodiode. When the
measured output verifies signal processing constraints, namely, the minimal
phase and the single sideband constraints, Kramers-Kronig detection
reconstructs the phase of the signal from the intensity measurements via a
digitally computed Hilbert transform. The local oscillator being known,
Kramers-Kronig detection allows for reconstructing the quadratures of the
unknown field. We show that this result holds in the quantum regime up to first
order in the local oscillator amplitude and thus that Kramers-Kronig detection
acts as a coherent detection able to measure both quadratures, making it a
Gaussian measurement similar to double homodyne detection. We also study in
details the phase information measured by Kramers-Kronig detection for bosonic
coherent states, monomode pure states and mixed states. Finally, we propose and
investigate a spectral tomography protocol for single-photon states that is
inspired by Kramers-Kronig detection and relies on a spectral engineering of
the single-photon.

  Geometry and Physics",,10.1016/j.geomphys.2025.105456,,math.QA math-ph math.AG math.MP,http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/,"  It is shown that every $2$-shifted Poisson structure on a finitely generated
semi-free commutative differential graded algebra $A$ defines a very explicit
infinitesimal $2$-braiding on the homotopy $2$-category of the symmetric
monoidal dg-category of finitely generated semi-free $A$-dg-modules. This
provides a concrete realization, to first order in the deformation parameter
$\hbar$, of the abstract deformation quantization results in derived algebraic
geometry due to Calaque, Pantev, To\""en, Vaqui\'e and Vezzosi. Of particular
interest is the case when $A$ is the Chevalley-Eilenberg algebra of a Lie
$N$-algebra, where the braided monoidal deformations developed in this paper
may be interpreted as candidates for representation categories of `higher
quantum groups'.
