ecology and behaviour. Knowing where fish migrate, how they interact with their
environment, and how their size affects their behaviour can help ecologists
develop more effective conservation and management strategies to protect fish
populations and their habitats. Deep learning is a promising tool to analyze
fish ecology from underwater videos. However, training deep neural networks
(DNNs) for fish tracking and segmentation requires high-quality labels, which
are expensive to obtain. We propose an alternative unsupervised approach that
relies on spatial and temporal variations in video data to generate noisy
pseudo-ground-truth labels. We train a multitask DNN using these pseudo-labels.
Our framework consists of three stages: (1) an optical flow model generates the
pseudo labels using spatial and temporal consistency between frames, (2) a
self-supervised model refines the pseudo-labels incrementally, and (3) a
segmentation network uses the refined labels for training. Consequently, we
perform extensive experiments to validate our method on three public underwater
video datasets and demonstrate its effectiveness for video annotation and
segmentation. We also evaluate its robustness to different imaging conditions
and discuss its limitations.

2403.01529,Cong Li,Cong Li,"Deep Incremental Model Informed Reinforcement Learning for Continuous
  Robotic Control",,,,,cs.RO cs.SY eess.SY,http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/,"  Model-based reinforcement learning attempts to use an available or learned
model to improve the data efficiency of reinforcement learning. This work
proposes a one-step lookback approach that jointly learns the deep incremental
model and the policy to realize the sample-efficient continuous robotic
control, wherein the control-theoretical knowledge is utilized to decrease the
model learning difficulty and facilitate efficient training. Specifically, we
use one-step backward data to facilitate the deep incremental model, an
alternative structured representation of the robotic evolution model, that
accurately predicts the robotic movement but with low sample complexity. This
is because the formulated deep incremental model degrades the model learning
difficulty into a parametric matrix learning problem, which is especially
favourable to high-dimensional robotic applications. The imagined data from the
learned deep incremental model is used to supplement training data to enhance
the sample efficiency. Comparative numerical simulations on benchmark
continuous robotics control problems are conducted to validate the efficiency
of our proposed one-step lookback approach.
