  quantum-dynamical scrambling",Accepted for publication in Quantum,,,,quant-ph cond-mat.stat-mech,http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/,"  A key conjecture about the evolution of complex quantum systems towards an
ergodic steady state, known as scrambling, is that this process acquires
universal features when it is most efficient. We develop a single-parameter
scaling theory for the spectral statistics in this scenario, which embodies
exact self-similarity of the spectral correlations along the complete
scrambling dynamics. We establish that the scaling predictions are matched by a
privileged stochastic process and serve as bounds for other dynamical
scrambling scenarios, allowing one to quantify inefficient or incomplete
scrambling on all time scales.

  Surfaces with Lossy Interconnections: Modeling and Optimization",Accepted by IEEE for publication,,,,cs.IT eess.SP math.IT,http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/,"  Reconfigurable intelligent surface (RIS) is a key technology to control the
communication environment in future wireless networks. Recently, beyond
diagonal RIS (BD-RIS) emerged as a generalization of RIS achieving larger
coverage through additional tunable impedance components interconnecting the
RIS elements. However, conventional RIS and BD-RIS can effectively serve only
users in their proximity, resulting in limited coverage. To overcome this
limitation, in this paper, we investigate distributed RIS, whose elements are
distributed over a wide region, in opposition to localized RIS commonly
considered in the literature. The scaling laws of distributed BD-RIS reveal
that it offers significant gains over distributed conventional RIS and
localized BD-RIS, enabled by its interconnections allowing signal propagation
within the BD-RIS. To assess the practical performance of distributed BD-RIS,
we model and optimize BD-RIS with lossy interconnections through transmission
line theory. Our model accounts for phase changes and losses over the BD-RIS
interconnections arising when the interconnection lengths are not much smaller
than the wavelength. Numerical results show that the performance of localized
BD-RIS is only slightly impacted by losses, given the short interconnection
lengths. Besides, distributed BD-RIS can achieve orders of magnitude of gains
over conventional RIS, even in the presence of low losses.

  model","6 pages, 5 figures","Europhysics Letters 149, 38001 (2025)",10.1209/0295-5075/ada8d6,,cond-mat.dis-nn,http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/,"  We study the critical behaviors of the ground and first excited states in the
one-dimensional nonreciprocal Aubry-Andr{\'e}-Harper model using both the
self-normal and biorthogonal fidelity susceptibilities. We demonstrate that
fidelity susceptibility serves as a probe for the phase transition in the
nonreciprocal AAH model. For ground states, characterized by real eigenenergies
across the entire regime, both fidelity susceptibilities near the critical
points scale as $N^{2}$, akin to the Hermitian AAH model. However, for the
first-excited states, the fidelity susceptibilities exhibit distinct scaling
laws, contingent upon whether the lattice consists of even or odd sites. For
even lattices, both the self-normal and biorthogonal fidelity susceptibilities
near the critical points continue to scale as $N^{2}$. In contrast, for odd
lattices, the biorthogonal fidelity susceptibilities diverge, while the
self-normal fidelity susceptibilities exhibit linear behavior, indicating a
novel scaling law.

  encoding",,"PRX Quantum 6, 010330 (2025)",10.1103/PRXQuantum.6.010330,,quant-ph,http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/,"  Although the similarity between non-stabilizer states -- also known as magic
states -- in discrete-variable systems and non-Gaussian states in
continuous-variable systems has widely been recognized, the precise connections
between these two notions have still been unclear. We establish a fundamental
link between these two quantum resources via the Gottesman-Kitaev-Preskill
(GKP) encoding. We show that the negativity of the continuous-variable Wigner
function for an encoded GKP state coincides with a magic measure we introduce,
which matches the negativity of the discrete Wigner function for odd
dimensions. We also provide a continuous-variable representation of the
stabilizer R\'enyi entropy -- a recent proposal for a magic measure for
multi-qubit states. With this in hand, we give a classical simulation algorithm
with runtime scaling with the resource contents, quantified by our magic
measures. We also employ our results to prove that implementing a multi-qubit
logical non-Clifford operation in the GKP code subspace requires a non-Gaussian
operation even at the limit of perfect encoding, despite the fact that the
ideal GKP states already come with a large amount of non-Gaussianity.
