  Telmo P\'erez-Izquierdo","Finding patterns of meaning: Reassessing Construal Clustering via
  Bipolar Class Analysis",,,,,cs.SI,http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/,"  Empirical research on \textit{construals}--social affinity groups that share
similar patterns of meaning--has advanced significantly in recent years. This
progress is largely driven by the development of \textit{Construal Clustering
Methods} (CCMs), which group survey respondents into construal clusters based
on similarities in their response patterns. We identify key limitations of
existing CCMs, which affect their accuracy when applied to the typical
structures of available data, and introduce Bipolar Class Analysis (BCA), a CCM
designed to address these shortcomings. BCA measures similarity in response
shifts between expressions of support and rejection across survey respondents,
addressing conceptual and measurement challenges in existing methods. We
formally define BCA and demonstrate its advantages through extensive simulation
analyses, where it consistently outperforms existing CCMs in accurately
identifying construals. Along the way, we develop a novel data-generation
process that approximates more closely how individuals map latent opinions onto
observable survey responses, as well as a new metric to evaluate the
performance of CCMs. Additionally, we find that applying BCA to previously
studied real-world datasets reveals substantively different construal patterns
compared to those generated by existing CCMs in prior empirical analyses.
Finally, we discuss limitations of BCA and outline directions for future
research.

  Kaiser Ahmed Rocky, Abu Kowsar",Advances in multijunction solar cells: an overview,"21 pages, 3 figures",,,,physics.app-ph physics.optics,http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/,"  The advanced multijunction solar cell (MJSC) has emerged as a frontrunner in
photovoltaic literature due to its superior photoconversion efficiency (PCE)
owing to its complex fabrication procedure and high costs. This article aims to
systematically review the advancements of III-V MJSCs by focusing on
computational modelling and experimental fabrication methodologies. In
addition, it addresses the technical barriers that have hindered the
progression of MJSC technology while also evaluating the current status and
prospects of these cells. The findings indicate that III-V MJSCs hold
significant promise for space applications. However, advancements in materials
science, growth techniques, and structural optimization are crucial for
reducing fabrication costs to make these cells more viable for terrestrial use.
In this context, alternatives such as perovskite/Si or perovskite/chalcogenide
tandem solar cells emerge as viable options. By synthesizing insights from a
thorough analysis of recent literature, this review serves as a valuable
resource for researchers, industry practitioners, and newcomers seeking to
deepen their understanding of the research methodologies, growth techniques,
and the associated challenges and opportunities within the realm of MJSCs.

  Tuzel, Marco Cuturi","Graph-Based Captioning: Enhancing Visual Descriptions by Interconnecting
  Region Captions","59 pages, 42 figures",,,,cs.CV cs.AI cs.LG,http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/,"  Humans describe complex scenes with compositionality, using simple text
descriptions enriched with links and relationships. While vision-language
research has aimed to develop models with compositional understanding
capabilities, this is not reflected yet in existing datasets which, for the
most part, still use plain text to describe images. In this work, we propose a
new annotation strategy, graph-based captioning (GBC) that describes an image
using a labeled graph structure, with nodes of various types. The nodes in GBC
are created through a two-stage process: first, identifying and describing
entity nodes; second, linking these nodes by highlighting \textit{compositions}
and \textit{relations} among them. Since \textit{all} GBC nodes hold plain text
descriptions, GBC retains the flexibility found in natural language, but can
also encode hierarchical information in its edges. We demonstrate that GBC can
be produced automatically, using off-the-shelf multimodal LLMs and object
detection models, by building a new dataset GBC10M that gathers GBC annotations
for about 10M images of the CC12M dataset. Through CLIP training on GBC10M, we
show that leveraging GBC nodes' annotations -- particularly those in
composition and relation nodes -- significantly boosts the model's performance
across various benchmarks compared to when other annotations are used. To
further explore the opportunities provided by GBC, we also investigate the use
of GBC as middleware for text-to-image generation, and show the extra benefits
of incorporating the graph structure in this task. Our code and datasets are

  Physical Science students","28 pages, 8 figures, 8 tables, APA7; BibTeX issues resolved",,,,physics.ed-ph physics.data-an,http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/,"  In this article we assess the comprehension of physics concepts by Physical
Science and Engineering students enrolled in their first semester at the
University of Johannesburg (UJ), South Africa ($2022$). We employ different
graphical measures to explore similarities and differences using the results of
both pre- and post-test data from the Force Concept Inventory assessment tool,
from which we calculate dominant misconceptions (DMs) and gains. We also use
alluvial diagrams to track the choices made by these two groups of students
from pre- to post-test stages. In our analysis, we find that DM results
indicate that participating Engineering students outperformed Physical Science
students on average, however, the same types of normalised DMs persist at the
post-test level. We call these DMs ""persistent misconceptions."" This is very
useful when tracking persistent misconceptions, where when using repeated
measures and alluvial diagrams with smaller groups of students, we find that
Physical Science students tend to make more chaotic choices.
