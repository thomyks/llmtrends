2407.11598,Susanne Pumpluen,Susanne Pumpluen,"A classification of the division algebras that are isotopic to a cyclic
  Galois field extension","The last section of previous version has been removed, the rest is
  rewritten",,,,math.RA,http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/,"  We classify all division algebras that are principal Albert isotopes of a
cyclic Galois field extension of degree $n>2$ up to isomorphisms. We achieve a
``tight'' classification when the cyclic Galois field extension is cubic. The
classification is ``tight'' in the sense that the list of algebras has features
that make it easy to distinguish non-isomorphic ones.
