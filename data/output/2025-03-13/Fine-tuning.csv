  Augmentation with Pre-training",Accepted by TKDE,,,,cs.IR,http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/,"  Sequential recommendation systems are integral to discerning temporal user
preferences. Yet, the task of learning from abbreviated user interaction
sequences poses a notable challenge. Data augmentation has been identified as a
potent strategy to enhance the informational richness of these sequences.
Traditional augmentation techniques, such as item randomization, may disrupt
the inherent temporal dynamics. Although recent advancements in reverse
chronological pseudo-item generation have shown promise, they can introduce
temporal discrepancies when assessed in a natural chronological context. In
response, we introduce a sophisticated approach, Bidirectional temporal data
Augmentation with pre-training (BARec). Our approach leverages bidirectional
temporal augmentation and knowledge-enhanced fine-tuning to synthesize
authentic pseudo-prior items that retain user preferences and capture deeper
item semantic correlations, thus boosting the model's expressive power. Our
comprehensive experimental analysis on five benchmark datasets confirms the
superiority of BARec across both short and elongated sequence contexts.
Moreover, theoretical examination and case study offer further insight into the
model's logical processes and interpretability. The source code for our study
is publicly available at https://github.com/juyongjiang/BARec.

formulating ''path planning'' tasks that require an LLM to navigate to target
locations while avoiding obstacles and adhering to constraints. Leveraging this
benchmark, we systematically investigate LLMs including GPT-4 via different
few-shot prompting methodologies as well as BART and T5 of various sizes via
fine-tuning. Our experimental results show the promise of few-shot GPT-4 in
spatial reasoning, when it is prompted to reason and act interleavedly,
although it still fails to perform long-term temporal reasoning. In contrast,
while fine-tuned LLMs achieved impressive results on in-distribution reasoning
tasks, they struggled to generalize to larger environments or environments with
more obstacles.

both node classification and link prediction tasks. HDGL, unlike GNNs that rely

requires only a single pass through the data set. We report results of
experiments using widely used benchmark datasets which demonstrate that, on the
node classification task, HDGL achieves accuracy that is competitive with that
of the state-of-the-art GNN methods at substantially reduced computational

  Using a transformer model for T-cell response prediction, we show that the
danger of inflated predictive performance is not merely theoretical but occurs
in practice. Consequently, we propose a domain-aware evaluation scheme. We then
study different transfer learning techniques to deal with the multi-domain

show that our final model is competitive with existing state-of-the-art

computational challenges due to the huge number of dynamical degrees of freedom
required to correctly describe the complex multi-scale statistical correlations
of the velocity. On the other hand, kinetic mesoscale approaches based on the
Boltzmann equation, have the potential to describe a broad range of flows,
stretching well beyond the special case of gases close to equilibrium, which
results in the ordinary Navier-Stokes dynamics. Here we demonstrate that, by
properly tuning, a kinetic approach can statistically reproduce the
quantitative dynamics of the larger scales in turbulence, thereby providing an
alternative, computationally efficient and physically rooted approach towards
subgrid scale (SGS) modeling in turbulence. More specifically we show that by
leveraging on data from fully resolved Direct Numerical Simulation (DNS) we can
learn a collision operator for the discretized Boltzmann equation solver (the
lattice Boltzmann method), which effectively implies a turbulence subgrid
closure model. The mesoscopic nature of our formulation makes the learning
problem fully local in both space and time, leading to reduced computational
costs and enhanced generalization capabilities. We show that the model offers
superior performance compared to traditional methods, such as the Smagorinsky
model, being less dissipative and, therefore, being able to more closely
capture the intermittency of higher-order velocity correlations. This
foundational work lays the basis for extending the proposed framework to
different turbulent flow settings and -- most importantly -- to develop new
classes of hybrid data-driven kinetic-based models capable of faithfully
capturing the complex macroscopic dynamics of diverse physical systems such as
emulsions, non-Newtonian fluid and multiphase systems.

  Non-Gaussian Acyclic Model: Pairwise Likelihood Ratios, Prior Knowledge, and
  Path Enumeration",,,,,cs.LG stat.ME,http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/,"  Effective causal discovery is essential for learning the causal graph from
observational data. The linear non-Gaussian acyclic model (LiNGAM) operates
under the assumption of a linear data generating process with non-Gaussian
noise in determining the causal graph. Its assumption of unmeasured confounders
being absent, however, poses practical limitations. In response, empirical
research has shown that the reformulation of LiNGAM as a shortest path problem
(LiNGAM-SPP) addresses this limitation. Within LiNGAM-SPP, mutual information
is chosen to serve as the measure of independence. A challenge is introduced -
parameter tuning is now needed due to its reliance on kNN mutual information
estimators. The paper proposes a threefold enhancement to the LiNGAM-SPP
framework.
  First, the need for parameter tuning is eliminated by using the pairwise
likelihood ratio in lieu of kNN-based mutual information. This substitution is
validated on a general data generating process and benchmark real-world data
sets, outperforming existing methods especially when given a larger set of
features. The incorporation of prior knowledge is then enabled by a
node-skipping strategy implemented on the graph representation of all causal
orderings to eliminate violations based on the provided input of relative
orderings. Flexibility relative to existing approaches is achieved. Last among
the three enhancements is the utilization of the distribution of paths in the
graph representation of all causal orderings. From this, crucial properties of
the true causal graph such as the presence of unmeasured confounders and
sparsity may be inferred. To some extent, the expected performance of the
causal discovery algorithm may be predicted. The refinements above advance the
practicality and performance of LiNGAM-SPP, showcasing the potential of
graph-search-based methodologies in advancing causal discovery.

learning via fine-tuning. The model predicts the output power of the wind
turbine under normal behaviour based on features retrieved from supervisory

can be trained with SCADA data of at least a few years, (ii) it can incorporate
all SCADA data of all wind turbines in a wind farm as features, (iii) it
assumes that the output power follows a normal density with heteroscedastic
variance and (iv) it can predict the output of one wind turbine by borrowing
strength from the data of all other wind turbines in a farm. Probabilistic
guidelines for condition monitoring are given via a cumulative sum (CUSUM)
control chart, which is specifically designed based on a real-data
classification exercise and, hence, is adapted to the needs of a wind farm. We
illustrate the performance of our model in a real SCADA data example which

novel metrics to evaluate the efficacy and resilience of LLMs in tackling these
problems. Our analysis of existing zero-shot prompting techniques with
proprietary LLMs along with open-source LLMs reveals a general deficiency in
CoLeG. To alleviate these issues, we propose tailored approaches for different
categories of LLMs. For proprietary LLMs, we introduce a new instructional
prompt designed to mitigate the impact of long contexts. For open-source LLMs,
we develop a novel auxiliary task for fine-tuning to enhance CoLeG. Our
comprehensive results demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed methods,
showing improved performance on E-GSM. Additionally, we conduct an in-depth
analysis to differentiate the effects of semantic understanding and reasoning
efficacy, showing that our methods improves the latter. We also establish the
generalizability of our methods across several other MWP benchmarks. Our
findings highlight the limitations of current LLMs and offer practical
solutions correspondingly, paving the way for further exploration of model

processes, treating these powerful models as pre-trained diffusion models. This
work presents a novel method based on reinforcement learning (RL) to add such
controls using an offline dataset comprising inputs and labels. We formulate
this task as an RL problem, with the classifier learned from the offline
dataset and the KL divergence against pre-trained models serving as the reward
functions. Our method, $\textbf{CTRL}$ ($\textbf{C}$onditioning
pre-$\textbf{T}$rained diffusion models with $\textbf{R}$einforcement
$\textbf{L}$earning), produces soft-optimal policies that maximize the
abovementioned reward functions. We formally demonstrate that our method
enables sampling from the conditional distribution with additional controls
during inference. Our RL-based approach offers several advantages over existing
methods. Compared to classifier-free guidance, it improves sample efficiency
and can greatly simplify dataset construction by leveraging conditional
independence between the inputs and additional controls. Additionally, unlike
classifier guidance, it eliminates the need to train classifiers from
intermediate states to additional controls. The code is available at

than AdamW with 50% less memory footprint. Adam-mini reduces memory by cutting
down the learning rate resources in Adam (i.e., $1/\sqrt{v}$). By investigating
the Hessian structure of neural nets, we find Adam's $v$ might not function at
its full potential as effectively as we expected. We find that $\geq$ 99.9% of
these learning rates in $v$ could be harmlessly removed if we (1) carefully
partition the parameters into blocks following our new principle on Hessian
structure; (2) assign a single but good learning rate to each parameter block.
We then provide one simple way to find good learning rates and propose
Adam-mini. Empirically, we verify that Adam-mini performs on par or better than
AdamW on various language models sized from 39M to 13B for pre-training,
supervised fine-tuning, and RLHF. The reduced memory footprint of Adam-mini
also alleviates communication overheads among GPUs, thereby increasing
throughput. For instance, Adam-mini achieves 49.6% higher throughput than AdamW
when pre-training Llama 2-7B on $2\times$ A800-80GB GPUs, which saves 33%

adapting to new domains. In this paper, we leverage the egocentric video
foundation models (Ego-VFMs) based on video-language pre-training and propose a
parameter-efficient adaptation for egocentric video tasks, namely Ego-VPA. It
employs a local sparse approximation for each video frame/text feature using
the basis prompts, and the selected basis prompts are used to synthesize
video/text prompts. Since the basis prompts are shared across frames and
modalities, it models context fusion and cross-modal transfer in an efficient
fashion. Experiments show that Ego-VPA excels in lightweight adaptation (with
only 0.84% learnable parameters), largely improving over baselines and reaching
the performance of full fine-tuning.

  Image Segmentation",,,,,cs.CV,http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/,"  Large foundation models, known for their strong zero-shot generalization
capabilities, can be applied to a wide range of downstream tasks. However,
developing foundation models for medical image segmentation poses a significant
challenge due to the domain gap between natural and medical images. While
fine-tuning techniques based on the Segment Anything Model (SAM) have been
explored, they primarily focus on scaling up data or refining inference
strategies without incorporating domain-specific architectural designs,
limiting their zero-shot performance. To optimize segmentation performance
under standard inference settings and provide a strong baseline for future
research, we introduce SyncSAM, which employs a synchronized dual-branch
encoder that integrates convolution and Transformer features in a synchronized
manner to enhance medical image encoding, and a multi-scale dual-branch decoder
to preserve image details. SyncSAM is trained on two of the largest medical
image segmentation datasets, SA-Med2D-20M and IMed-361M, resulting in a series
of pre-trained models for universal medical image segmentation. Experimental
results demonstrate that SyncSAM not only achieves state-of-the-art performance
on test sets but also exhibits strong zero-shot capabilities on unseen
datasets. The code and model weights are available at
https://github.com/Hhankyangg/SyncSAM.
