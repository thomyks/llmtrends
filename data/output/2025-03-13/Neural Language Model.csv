2408.15753,Omer Rochman-Sharabi,Omer Rochman Sharabi and Sacha Lewin and Gilles Louppe,A Neural Material Point Method for Particle-based Emulation,,,,,cs.LG,http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/,"  Mesh-free Lagrangian methods are widely used for simulating fluids, solids,
and their complex interactions due to their ability to handle large
deformations and topological changes. These physics simulators, however,
require substantial computational resources for accurate simulations. To
address these issues, deep learning emulators promise faster and scalable
simulations, yet they often remain expensive and difficult to train, limiting
their practical use. Inspired by the Material Point Method (MPM), we present
NeuralMPM, a neural emulation framework for particle-based simulations.
NeuralMPM interpolates Lagrangian particles onto a fixed-size grid, computes
updates on grid nodes using image-to-image neural networks, and interpolates
back to the particles. Similarly to MPM, NeuralMPM benefits from the regular
voxelized representation to simplify the computation of the state dynamics,
while avoiding the drawbacks of mesh-based Eulerian methods. We demonstrate the
advantages of NeuralMPM on several datasets, including fluid dynamics and
fluid-solid interactions. Compared to existing methods, NeuralMPM reduces
training times from days to hours, while achieving comparable or superior
long-term accuracy, making it a promising approach for practical forward and
inverse problems. A project page is available at https://neuralmpm.isach.be
