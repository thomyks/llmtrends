  Average Estimator",Accepted to Machine Learning,,,,math.OC cs.LG,http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/,"  Although adaptive optimization algorithms have been successful in many
applications, there are still some mysteries in terms of convergence analysis
that have not been unraveled. This paper provides a novel non-convex analysis
of adaptive optimization to uncover some of these mysteries. Our contributions
are three-fold. First, we show that an increasing or large enough momentum
parameter for the first-order moment used in practice is sufficient to ensure
the convergence of adaptive algorithms whose adaptive scaling factors of the
step size are bounded. Second, our analysis gives insights for practical
implementations, e.g., increasing the momentum parameter in a stage-wise manner
in accordance with stagewise decreasing step size would help improve the
convergence. Third, the modular nature of our analysis allows its extension to
solving other optimization problems, e.g., compositional, min-max and bilevel
problems. As an interesting yet non-trivial use case, we present algorithms for
solving non-convex min-max optimization and bilevel optimization that do not
require using large batches of data to estimate gradients or double loops as
the literature do. Our empirical studies corroborate our theoretical results.

quantum metric spaces varies continuously in Rieffel's quantum Gromov-Hausdorff
distance. This continuity result includes the classical case where we recover
the round 3-sphere up to a global scaling factor on the metric. Our main
technical tool is a quantum SU(2) analogue of the Berezin transform, together
with its associated fuzzy approximations, the analysis of which also leads to a
systematic way of approximating Lipschitz operators by means of polynomial
expressions in the generators.

ferromagnetic resonance exhibit power-law scalings in frequency and temperature
for NFL metals induced near a quantum critical point (QCP). At the Ising
nematic QCP, we demonstrate that the enhanced Gilbert damping coefficient
$\delta \alpha$ acquires negative power-law exponents in distinct frequency
regimes. The exponents convey universal parameters inherited from the QCP and
reflect the non-quasiparticle nature of the spin carriers in the NFL metal. At
finite temperature, we show that the Gilbert damping mechanism is restored in
the quantum critical regime and $\delta \alpha$ measures the temperature
dependence of the correlation length. Our theoretical proposal has the
potential to stimulate the development of an interdisciplinary research domain
where insights from non-equilibrium spin physics in spintronics are integrated
into strongly correlated matter.

pushing the boundaries of measurement precision toward the ultimate Heisenberg
limit. This enhanced precision is normally attained by utilizing large squeezed
states or multi-particle entangled quantum states, both of which are often
challenging to implement and prone to decoherence in real quantum devices. In
this work, we present a versatile and on-demand protocol for deterministic
parameter estimation that leverages two efficient state-transfer operations on
a single bosonic mode. Specifically, we demonstrate this protocol in the
context of phase estimation using the superposition of coherent states in the
bosonic circuit quantum electrodynamics (cQED) platform. With low average
photon numbers of only up to 1.76, we achieve quantum-enhanced precision
approaching the Heisenberg scaling, reaching a metrological gain of 7.5(6) dB.
Importantly, we show that the gain or sensitivity range can be further enhanced
on the fly by tailoring the input states, with different superposition weights,
based on specific system constraints. The realization of this versatile and
efficient scheme affords a promising path towards practical quantum-enhanced
sensing, not only for bosonic cQED hardware but also readily extensible to
other continuous-variable platforms.

the competence of outcome models. While existing endeavors rely on heuristics

functions on sample mixtures unveils model performance on unseen mixtures
before actual runs, thus guiding the selection of an ideal data mixture.
Furthermore, we propose nested use of the scaling laws of training steps, model
sizes, and our data mixing law to enable predicting the performance of large
models trained on massive data under various mixtures with only small-scale
training. Moreover, experimental results verify that our method effectively
optimizes the training mixture of a 1B model trained for 100B tokens in

Here, we study emergent dipole-dipole interactions between emitters

state-of the-art experimental platforms. We show that the strength of such
photon-mediated interactions decays exponentially with distance with a
characteristic localization length which, unlike typical behaviours with
standard bands, saturates to a finite value as the emitter's energy approaches
the FB. Remarkably, we find that the localization length grows with the overlap
between CLSs according to an analytically-derived universal scaling law valid
for a large class of FBs both in 1D and 2D. Using giant atoms (non-local

has an inherent statistical uncertainty that is quantified by variance or mean
squared error of measurement outcome. While the uncertainty can be reduced by
averaging several samples, the number of samples should be minimized when each
sample is very costly. This is especially the case for fault-tolerant quantum
computing that involves measurement of multiple observables of non-trivial
states in large quantum systems that exceed the capabilities of classical
computers. In this work, we provide an adaptive quantum algorithm for
estimating the expectation values of $M$ general observables within root mean
squared error $\varepsilon$ simultaneously, using
$\mathcal{O}(\varepsilon^{-1}\sqrt{M}\log M)$ queries to a state preparation
oracle of a target state. This remarkably achieves the scaling of Heisenberg
limit $1/\varepsilon$, a fundamental bound on the estimation precision in terms
of mean squared error, together with the sublinear scaling of the number of
observables $M$. The proposed method is an adaptive version of the quantum
gradient estimation algorithm and has a resource-efficient implementation due
to its adaptiveness. Specifically, the space overhead in the proposed method is
$\mathcal{O}(M)$ which is independent from the estimation precision
$\varepsilon$ unlike non-iterative algorithms. In addition, our method can
avoid the numerical instability problem for constructing quantum circuits in a
large-scale task (e.g., $\varepsilon\ll 1$ in our case), which appears in the
actual implementation of many algorithms relying on quantum signal processing
techniques. Our method paves a new way to precisely understand and predict
various physical properties in complicated quantum systems using quantum
computers.

effectively supports collaboration among over a thousand agents, with irregular
topologies outperforming regular ones. We also identify a collaborative scaling
law--the overall performance follows a logistic growth pattern as agents scale,
with collaborative emergence occurring earlier than traditional neural
emergence. We speculate this may be because scaling agents catalyzes their

thereby producing more comprehensive artifacts. The code is available at

  Regression",,,,,stat.ML cs.LG,http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/,"  We examine the implicit bias of mirror flow in univariate least squares error
regression with wide and shallow neural networks. For a broad class of
potential functions, we show that mirror flow exhibits lazy training and has
the same implicit bias as ordinary gradient flow when the network width tends
to infinity. For ReLU networks, we characterize this bias through a variational
problem in function space. Our analysis includes prior results for ordinary
gradient flow as a special case and lifts limitations which required either an
intractable adjustment of the training data or networks with skip connections.
We further introduce scaled potentials and show that for these, mirror flow
still exhibits lazy training but is not in the kernel regime. For networks with
absolute value activations, we show that mirror flow with scaled potentials
induces a rich class of biases, which generally cannot be captured by an RKHS
norm. A takeaway is that whereas the parameter initialization determines how
strongly the curvature of the learned function is penalized at different
locations of the input space, the scaled potential determines how the different
magnitudes of the curvature are penalized.

data selection as a generalized Optimal Control problem, which can be solved
theoretically by Pontryagin's Maximum Principle (PMP), yielding a set of
necessary conditions that characterize the relationship between optimal data
selection and LM training dynamics. Based on these theoretical results, we
introduce PMP-based Data Selection (PDS), a framework that approximates optimal
data selection by solving the PMP conditions. In our experiments, we adopt PDS
to select data from CommmonCrawl and show that the PDS-selected corpus
accelerates the learning of LMs and constantly boosts their performance on a
wide range of downstream tasks across various model sizes. Moreover, the
benefits of PDS extend to ~400B models trained on ~10T tokens, as evidenced by
the extrapolation of the test loss curves according to the Scaling Laws. PDS
also improves data utilization when the pre-training data is limited, by
reducing the data demand by 1.8 times, which helps mitigate the quick
exhaustion of available web-crawled corpora. Our code, model, and data can be

Markovian estimate for the steady-state dissipation rate on the coarse-graining
scale in self-similar networks reflects a scale-dependent energy dissipation.
By explicit examples, it is demonstrated here that there are in general no
relations between such an apparent power-law dependence and the actual
dissipation on different length scales. We construct fractal networks with a
single dissipative scale and networks with a true inverse energy-dissipation
cascade, and show that they display the same scaling behavior. Moreover, we
show that a self-similar network structure does not imply an inverse power-law
scaling but may be mistaken for one in practice. When no dissipative cycles
become hidden by the coarse graining, any scale dependence of the dissipation
estimate vanishes if the memory is correctly accounted for in the time-reversal
operation. A $k$-th order estimator is derived and necessary and sufficient
conditions are proved for a guaranteed lower bound on dissipation. These
higher-order estimators saturated in the order are proved to provide sharper
lower bounds on dissipation and their scale dependence signifies hidden
dissipative cycles. It is shown that estimators not saturated in the order may
erroneously overestimate the microscopic dissipation. Our results underscore
the still underappreciated importance of correctly accounting for memory in
analyzing coarse observations.

  Representations (ICLR 2025)",,,,cs.LG cs.AI,http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/,"  Scaling laws offer valuable insights into the design of time series
foundation models (TSFMs). However, previous research has largely focused on
the scaling laws of TSFMs for in-distribution (ID) data, leaving their
out-of-distribution (OOD) scaling behavior and the influence of model
architectures less explored. In this work, we examine two common TSFM
architectures, encoder-only and decoder-only Transformers, and investigate
their scaling behavior on both ID and OOD data. These models are trained and
evaluated across varying parameter counts, compute budgets, and dataset sizes.
Our experiments reveal that the log-likelihood loss of TSFMs exhibits similar
scaling behavior in both OOD and ID settings. We further compare the scaling
properties across different architectures, incorporating two state-of-the-art
TSFMs as case studies, showing that model architecture plays a significant role
in scaling. The encoder-only Transformers demonstrate better scalability than
the decoder-only Transformers, while the architectural enhancements in the two
advanced TSFMs primarily improve ID performance but reduce OOD scalability.
While scaling up TSFMs is expected to drive performance breakthroughs, the lack
of a comprehensive understanding of TSFM scaling laws has hindered the
development of a robust framework to guide model scaling. We fill this gap in
this work by synthesizing our findings and providing practical guidelines for
designing and scaling larger TSFMs with enhanced model capabilities.

operator growth in quantum systems by analyzing how operators spread within the
Krylov space, a subspace of the Hilbert space spanned by successive
applications of the superoperator $[H,\cdot]$ on an initial operator. Using the
Lanczos algorithm, we construct an orthonormal Krylov basis and derive the
Lanczos coefficients, which govern the operator connectivity and thus
characterize the complexity. Our study reveals that the Lanczos coefficients
$\{b_{n}\}$ are independent of the chemical potential, while $\{a_{n}\}$
exhibits a dependence on it. Both $\{a_{n}\}$ and $\{b_{n}\}$ show linear
relationships with respect to $n$. For both bosonic and fermionic systems, the
Krylov complexities behave similarly over time, especially at late times, due
to the analogous profiles of the squared absolute values of their
autocorrelation functions $\abs{\varphi_{0}(t)}^{2}$. The Krylov complexity
grows exponentially with time, but its asymptotic scaling factor $\lambda_{K}$
is significantly smaller than the twice of the slope of the $\{b_{n}\}$
coefficients, contrasting to the relativistic field theories where the scaling
aligns more closely with the twice of the slope of $\{b_{n}\}$.

(MLLMs) in the vision understanding domain. The success of these models can
largely be attributed to the dominant scaling law, which states that larger
parameter sizes and data volumes contribute to better performance. Notably,
data scaling has mainly been powered by automatic data pipelines, which center
around the self-instruction of LLMs. The paradigm has been taken for granted
for quite some time, but the study of the effectiveness of scaling with these
data has been neglected for a long time. In this context, this work revisits
scaling with synthetic data and focuses on developing video-LLMs from a
data-centric perspective. Our main study approach is fine-tuning pre-trained
image-LLMs with video data and investigating learning efficiency through data
scaling. Results from our preliminary experiments reveal a low learning
efficiency phenomenon when simply scaling up video data samples, which, through
our probing, can be ascribed to a lack of instruction diversity. Aiming at this
issue, we propose a data augmentation method called Sparrow, which synthesizes
video-like samples from pure text instruction data. Mixing these synthetic
samples with the video data enables a more efficient training scheme. Through
comprehensive experiments, we demonstrate that our proposed method achieves
performance comparable to or even superior to baselines trained with many more
samples. Meanwhile, we find that incorporating these synthetic samples can
boost the performance of long video understanding without training with long
video data. The code and data examples are available at

functions of d distributed parameters beyond the capability of separable
sensors. Continuous-variable DQM involves using a linear network with at least
one nonclassical input. Here we fully elucidate the structure of linear
networks with two non-vacuum inputs which allows us to prove a number of
fundamental properties of continuous-variable DQM. While measuring the sum of d
parameters at the Heisenberg limit can be achieved with a single non-vacuum
input, we show that two inputs, one of which can be classical, is required to
measure an arbitrary linear combination of d parameters and an arbitrary global
function of the parameters. We obtain a universal and tight upper bound on the
sensitivity of DQM networks with two inputs, and completely characterize the
properties of the nonclassical input required to obtain a quantum advantage.
This reveals that a wide range of nonclassical states make this possible,
including a squeezed vacuum. We also show that for a class of nonclassical
inputs local photon number detection will achieve the maximum sensitivity.
Finally we show that a general DQM network has two distinct regimes. The first
achieves Heisenberg scaling. In the second the nonclassical input is much
weaker than the coherent input, nevertheless providing a multiplicative
enhancement to the otherwise classical sensitivity.

central nervous system, primarily manifesting in childhood. It is characterized
by atypical and repetitive behaviors. Currently, diagnostic methods mainly rely
on questionnaire surveys and behavioral observations, which are prone to
misdiagnosis due to their subjective nature. With advancements in medical
imaging, MR imaging-based diagnostics have emerged as a more objective
alternative. In this paper, we propose a Hierarchical Neural Network model for
ASD identification, termed ASD-HNet, which hierarchically extracts features
from functional brain networks based on resting-state functional magnetic
resonance imaging (rs-fMRI) data. This hierarchical approach enhances the
extraction of brain representations, improving diagnostic accuracy and aiding
in the identification of brain regions associated with ASD. Specifically,
features are extracted at three levels: (1) the local region of interest (ROI)
scale, (2) the community scale, and (3) the global representation scale. At the
ROI scale, graph convolution is employed to transfer features between ROIs. At
the community scale, functional gradients are introduced, and a K-Means
clustering algorithm is applied to group ROIs with similar functional gradients
into communities. Features from ROIs within the same community are then
extracted to characterize the communities. At the global representation scale,
we extract global features from the whole community-scale brain networks to
represent the entire brain. We validate the effectiveness of our method using
the publicly available Autism Brain Imaging Data Exchange I (ABIDE-I) dataset.
Experimental results demonstrate that ASD-HNet outperforms existing methods.

this regime crosses over to normal diffusion regime which is most robust when
nonintegrability is strong. For strong nonintegrability, the system ends up in
a homogeneous state while for weak nonintegrability the oscillations and
inhomogeneities persist, despite the fact that chaos is nearly always strong

is suppressed as a universal power law with the quench time scale. A
conflicting observation, which termed anti-Kibble-Zurek dynamics has been
reported in several studies, specifically in the driven systems with an
uncorrelated stochastic (white) noise. Here, we study the defect generation in
the driven transverse field/anisotropy quantum $XY$ model in the presence of a
correlated (colored) Gaussian noise. We propose a generic conjecture that
properly capture the noise-induced excitation features, which shows good
agreement with the numerical simulations. We show that, the dynamical features
of defect density are modified by varying the noise correlation time. Our
numerical simulations confirm that, for fast noises, the dynamics of the defect
density is the same as that of the uncorrelated (white) noise, as is expected.
However, the larger ratio of noise correlation time to the annealing time
results in larger defects density formation and reforms the universal dynamical
features. Our finding reveals that, the noise-induced defects scale linearly
with the annealing time for fast noises, while in the presence of the slow
noises, the noise-induced defects scale linearly with the square of the
annealing time. The numerical simulations confirm that, the optimal annealing
time, at which the defects density is minimum, scales linearly in logarithmic
scale with the total noise power having different exponents for the fast and
slow noises.

  Language Model Pretraining",22 pages,,,,cs.LG cs.AI,http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/,"  The impressive capabilities of Large Language Models (LLMs) across diverse
tasks are now well-established, yet their effective deployment necessitates
careful hyperparameter optimization. Through extensive empirical studies
involving grid searches across diverse configurations, we discover universal
scaling laws governing these hyperparameters: optimal learning rate follows a
power-law relationship with both model parameters and data sizes, while optimal
batch size scales primarily with data sizes. Our analysis reveals a convex
optimization landscape for hyperparameters under fixed models and data size
conditions. This convexity implies an optimal hyperparameter plateau. We
contribute a universal, plug-and-play optimal hyperparameter tool for the
community. Its estimated values on the test set are merely 0.09% away from the
globally optimal LLM performance found via an exhaustive search. These laws
demonstrate remarkable robustness across variations in model sparsity, training
data distribution, and model shape. To our best known, this is the first work
that unifies different model shapes and structures, such as Mixture-of-Experts
models and dense transformers, as well as establishes optimal hyperparameter
scaling laws across diverse data distributions. This exhaustive optimization
process demands substantial computational resources, utilizing nearly one
million NVIDIA H800 GPU hours to train 3,700 LLMs of varying sizes and
hyperparameters from scratch and consuming approximately 100 trillion tokens in
total. To facilitate reproducibility and further research, we will
progressively release all loss measurements and model checkpoints through our
designated repository https://step-law.github.io/

  Ubiquitous Computing",,,,,cs.CL,http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/,"  While scaling laws have been continuously validated in large language models
(LLMs) with increasing model parameters, the inherent tension between the
inference demands of LLMs and the limited resources of edge devices poses a
critical challenge to the development of edge intelligence. Recently, numerous
small language models have emerged, aiming to distill the capabilities of LLMs
into smaller footprints. However, these models often retain the fundamental
architectural principles of their larger counterparts, still imposing
considerable strain on the storage and bandwidth capacities of edge devices. In
this paper, we introduce the PLM, a Peripheral Language Model, developed
through a co-design process that jointly optimizes model architecture and edge
system constraints. The PLM utilizes a Multi-head Latent Attention mechanism
and employs the squared ReLU activation function to encourage sparsity, thereby
reducing peak memory footprint during inference. During training, we collect
and reorganize open-source datasets, implement a multi-phase training strategy,
and empirically investigate the Warmup-Stable-Decay-Constant (WSDC) learning
rate scheduler. Additionally, we incorporate Reinforcement Learning from Human
Feedback (RLHF) by adopting the ARIES preference learning approach. Following a
two-phase SFT process, this method yields performance gains of 2% in general
tasks, 9% in the GSM8K task, and 11% in coding tasks. In addition to its novel
architecture, evaluation results demonstrate that PLM outperforms existing
small language models trained on publicly available data while maintaining the
lowest number of activated parameters. Furthermore, deployment across various
edge devices, including consumer-grade GPUs, mobile phones, and Raspberry Pis,
validates PLM's suitability for peripheral applications. The PLM series models
are publicly available at https://github.com/plm-team/PLM.

  Manufacturing Cost Considerations",,,,,cs.ET,http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/,"  Modular design maximizes utility by using standardized components in
large-scale systems. From a manufacturing perspective, it supports green
technology by reducing material waste and improving reusability. Industrially,
it offers economic benefits through economies of scale, making it a practical
design strategy. Typically, modularization selects a representative design from
predefined candidates to meet all performance requirements. However, achieving
effective modularization in mechanical mechanisms presents challenges. First,
mechanisms depend on geometric relationships for functional motion, and varying
loads lead to different optimal parameters, complicating representative design
selection. Second, the chosen design often exceeds optimal parameters, causing
over-specification and performance deviations, which worsen as scale increases.
To address this, we propose a modular mechanism design framework using
surrogate-based optimization. This approach finds optimal designs for
large-scale systems and partitions them into groups, each assigned an optimized
design. This multi-objective optimization (MOO) problem balances economies of
scale and performance consistency. Unlike conventional methods based on
predefined candidates and simple grouping, our framework optimizes design
variables flexibly for modularization. Additionally, we analyze manufacturing
cost parameters to develop a decision support system for selecting optimal
strategies in diverse design scenarios. This enhances maintainability, improves
interchangeability, and fosters environmentally sustainable manufacturing.

0.49, indicating that the region is in a state of virial equilibrium. In
contrast, a detailed analysis of the central N66 region revealed a

demonstrate that an apparent horizon forms once sufficient mass accretes onto
the black hole. We derive the evolution of the Bondi mass and compute its final
value, enabling us to quantify the fraction of the incident mass absorbed by
the black hole. Additionally, we establish a scaling law for the absorbed mass
as a function of initial parameters, such as the amplitude of the gravitational
wave data. Furthermore, we explore the dynamics when a reflecting barrier
surrounds the black hole. For low-amplitude initial waves, the barrier reflects
the waves, leaving the original black hole as the end state. Conversely,
high-amplitude waves lead to the formation of an apparent horizon that engulfs
the barrier, producing a new, larger black hole.

systems with competing short- and global-range couplings. We monitor the
non-equilibrium dynamics of the correlations following a quench, showing that
for strong short-range couplings the propagation of correlations is dominated
at short and intermediate distances by a causal, light-cone, dynamics,
resembling the purely short-range quantum systems. However, the interplay of
short- and global-range couplings leads to a crossover between space-time
regions in which the light-cone persists to regions where a supersonic,
distance-independent, spreading of the correlations occurs. We identify the
important ingredients needed for capturing the supersonic spreading and
demonstrate our findings in systems of interacting bosonic atoms, in which the
global range coupling is realized by a coupling to a cavity light field, or
atomic long-range interactions, respectively. We show that our results hold in

characterize the short time power-law scaling of the distance-independent

themes in modern physics. Recently, the stabilizer R\'{e}nyi entropy (SRE) has
emerged as a computationally tractable measure of nonstabilizerness, a crucial
resource for fault-tolerant universal quantum computation. While numerical
results suggested that the SRE in critical states can exhibit universal
behavior, its comprehensive theoretical understanding has remained elusive. In
this work, we develop a field-theoretical framework for the SRE in a
$(1+1)$-dimensional many-body system and elucidate its universal aspects using
boundary conformal field theory. We demonstrate that the SRE is equivalent to a
participation entropy in the Bell basis of a doubled Hilbert space, which can
be calculated from the partition function of a replicated field theory with the
interlayer line defect created by the Bell-state measurements. This
identification allows us to characterize the universal contributions to the SRE
on the basis of the data of conformal boundary conditions imposed on the
replicated theory. We find that the SRE of the entire system contains a
universal size-independent term determined by the noninteger ground-state
degeneracy known as the g-factor. In contrast, we show that the mutual SRE
exhibits the logarithmic scaling with a universal coefficient given by the
scaling dimension of a boundary condition changing operator, which elucidates
the origin of universality previously observed in numerical results. As a
concrete demonstration, we present a detailed analysis of the Ising
criticality, where we analytically derive the universal quantities at arbitrary
R\'{e}nyi indices and numerically validate them with high accuracy by employing
tensor network methods. These results establish a field-theoretical approach to
understanding the universal features of nonstabilizerness in quantum many-body

nanodroplets in a high Ohnesorge number regime (0.4 < Oh < 1) on a
superhydrophobic surface and the dynamics of droplets when a stationary droplet
on a solid surface is struck by another droplet of similar size from above,
using molecular dynamics simulation. The first part of this study identified
the critical droplet size below which coalescence-induced jumping terminates,
developed a universal jumping mechanism for droplets of all types, explained a
special phenomenon of jumping velocity becoming maximum before it approaches
zero, and investigated how jumping terminates due to the size difference
between droplets. These findings align well with prior micro-level studies and
experimental predictions. The second part of this study investigated the
jumping process of the merged droplet after the impact of a moving droplet upon
a stationary one. The impact velocity, droplet size, surface textures, and
wettability are influential factors on the jumping velocity in this case.
Scaling laws for maximum spreading time, spreading factor, and restitution
coefficient are formulated based on the Weber (We) number and the Reynolds (Re)
number. These laws differ from those established for single-droplet impacts.
For superhydrophobic surfaces, the spreading time is approximated by three
times the droplet radius and impact velocity, and with the dimensionless
spreading time, it exhibits a linear relationship with We 0.31. For both cases,
the jumping process is primarily governed by the energy available for
conversion into the kinetic energy of the merged droplet following dissipation.
For the droplet impact case, the energy conversion efficiency becomes constant
at high-impact droplet velocities. About 1% of the energy is dissipated due to
surface adhesion, which reduces at higher impact velocity.

diffusion markets. These are markets with one risky asset, which is modeled as
a regular continuous strong Markov process that is also a semimartingale, and a
riskless asset that grows exponentially at a constant rate $r\in \mathbb{R}$.
All deterministic criteria are provided in terms of the scale function and the
speed measure of the risky asset process. Our study reveals a variety of
surprising effects. For instance, irrespective of the interest rate, NIP is not
excluded by reflecting boundaries or an irregular scale function. In the case
of non-zero interest rates, it is even possible that NUPBR holds in the
presence of reflecting boundaries and/or skew thresholds. In the zero interest
rate regime, we also identify NSA as the minimal no arbitrage notion that
excludes reflecting boundaries and that forces the scale function to be
continuously differentiable with strictly positive absolutely continuous
derivative, meaning that it is of the same form as for a stochastic
differential equation.

modern statistical physics, with recent attention increasingly directed toward
nonequilibrium phases that exhibit rich dynamical phenomena. A striking example
arises in nonreciprocal systems, where asymmetric interactions between
components lead to inherently dynamic phases and unconventional criticality
near a critical exceptional point (CEP), where the criticality arises from the
coalescence of collective modes to the Nambu-Goldstone mode. However, the
universal scaling behavior that should emerge in this system with full
consideration of many-body effects and stochastic noise remains largely
elusive. Here, we establish a dynamical scaling law in a generic
one-dimensional stochastic nonreciprocal $O(2)$-symmetric system. Through
large-scale simulations, we uncover a new nonequilibrium scaling in the
vicinity of transition, distinct from any previously known equilibrium or
nonequilibrium universality classes. In regimes where the system breaks into
domains with opposite chirality, we demonstrate that fluctuations are strongly
suppressed, leading to a logarithmic scaling as a function of system size $L$,
in contrast to the conventional power-law scaling expected from dynamical
scaling theory. This work elucidates the beyond-mean-field dynamics of
non-reciprocal matter, thereby sheding light on the exploration of criticality
in nonreciprocal phase transition across diverse physical contexts, from active
matter and driven quantum systems to biological pattern formation and
non-Hermitian physics.

training size, demonstrate the diminishing returns of unselective data
expansion. Hence, data governance is proposed to downsize datasets through
pruning non-informative samples. Yet, isolating the impact of a specific sample
on overall model performance is challenging, due to the vast computation
required for tryout all sample combinations. Current data governors circumvent
this complexity by estimating sample contributions through heuristic-derived
scalar scores, thereby discarding low-value ones. Despite thorough sample
sieving, retained samples contain substantial undesired tokens intrinsically,
underscoring the potential for further compression and purification. In this
work, we upgrade data governance from a 'sieving' approach to a 'juicing' one.
Instead of scanning for least-flawed samples, our dual-branch DataJuicer
applies finer-grained intra-sample governance. It squeezes out informative
tokens and boosts image-text alignments. Specifically, the vision branch
retains salient image patches and extracts relevant object classes, while the
text branch incorporates these classes to enhance captions. Consequently,
DataJuicer yields more refined datasets through finer-grained governance.
Extensive experiments across datasets demonstrate that DataJuicer significantly
outperforms existing DataSieve in image-text retrieval, classification, and
dense visual reasoning.

initial conditions. We find that the abundance of produced particles is
sensitive to pre-inflationary initial conditions, resulting in the uncertainty
of many orders of magnitude. Nevertheless, a lower bound on the particle
abundance can be obtained. High scale inflation is very efficient in particle
production, which leads to strong constraints on the existence of stable
scalars with masses below the inflationary Hubble rate. For example, free
stable scalars are allowed only if they have masses below an eV or the
reheating temperature is in the GeV range or below. We find universal scaling
behavior of the particle abundance, which covers free and feebly interacting

considerations are important in the context of non-thermal dark matter since

scaling laws are established for exciton binding energy as a function of the

exciton fine structure for various 2D perovskites is examined to measure the

organic spacers, significantly influence the exchange interaction, driving a
tunable energy spacing between dark and bright excitons. This unique feature of

  Splatting",,,,,cs.CV,http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/,"  Edges are one of the most basic parametric primitives to describe structural
information in 3D. In this paper, we study parametric 3D edge reconstruction
from calibrated multi-view images. Previous methods usually reconstruct a 3D
edge point set from multi-view 2D edge images, and then fit 3D edges to the
point set. However, noise in the point set may cause gaps among fitted edges,
and the recovered edges may not align with input multi-view images since the
edge fitting depends only on the reconstructed 3D point set. To mitigate these
problems, we propose SketchSplat, a method to reconstruct accurate, complete,
and compact 3D edges via differentiable multi-view sketch splatting. We
represent 3D edges as sketches, which are parametric lines and curves defined
by attributes including control points, scales, and opacity. During edge
reconstruction, we iteratively sample Gaussian points from a set of sketches
and rasterize the Gaussians onto 2D edge images. Then the gradient of the image
error with respect to the input 2D edge images can be back-propagated to
optimize the sketch attributes. Our method bridges 2D edge images and 3D edges
in a differentiable manner, which ensures that 3D edges align well with 2D
images and leads to accurate and complete results. We also propose a series of
adaptive topological operations and apply them along with the sketch
optimization. The topological operations help reduce the number of sketches
required while ensuring high accuracy, yielding a more compact reconstruction.
Finally, we contribute an accurate 2D edge detector that improves the
performance of both ours and existing methods. Experiments show that our method
achieves state-of-the-art accuracy, completeness, and compactness on a
benchmark CAD dataset.

made of identical cells of connected open polygonal billiards with parallel

faster than linearly. We show that irrespective of the geometry of these

two different exponents, separated by a crossover region that is determined by
the MSD. We find that the distribution of first return times satisfies a simple
scaling form. In turn, the transmission coefficient, defined as the fraction of
trajectories that starting at the cell at the origin escape the channel through
the other boundary, decays algebraically with the size of the system, and, as a
signature of non-recurrent transport, sometimes slower. From these two
processes we derive a locking relation among the scaling exponents for the
asymptotic behavior of the MSD, the times of first return to the origin and the
way transmission decays with the system size, showing that these three
processes are interdependent. The locking relation holds for diffusive
processes, as well as for fractional Brownian motion with arbitrary Hurst
exponent. We argue that the locking relation may be valid for many other
transport processes, Markovian or not, with finite MSD.

shocks and magnetic reconnection in collisionless plasma environments. While
empirical scaling laws for the temperature increase have been obtained, the
precise mechanism of energy partition between ions and electrons remains
unclear. Here we show, based on coupled theoretical and observational scaling
analyses, that the temperature increase, $\Delta T$, depends linearly on three
factors: the available magnetic energy per particle, the Alfv\'{e}n Mach number
(or reconnection rate), and the characteristic spatial scale $L$. Based on
statistical datasets obtained from Earth's plasma environment, we find that $L$
is on the order of (1) the ion gyro-radius for ion heating at shocks, (2) the
ion inertial length for ion heating in magnetic reconnection, and (3) the
hybrid inertial length for electron heating in both shocks and magnetic
reconnection. With these scales, we derive the ion-to-electron ratios of
temperature increase as $\Delta T_{\rm i}/\Delta T_{\rm e} = (3\beta_{\rm

heating in space plasmas, enabling more sophisticated modeling of its scaling

  Learning in Medical Image Segmentation","18 pages, 7 figures, 6 tables",,,,cs.CV,http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/,"  Deep learning-based medical image segmentation has shown remarkable success;
however, it typically requires extensive pixel-level annotations, which are
both expensive and time-intensive. Semi-supervised medical image segmentation
(SSMIS) offers a viable alternative, driven by advancements in CNNs and ViTs.
However, these networks often rely on single fixed activation functions and
linear modeling patterns, limiting their ability to effectively learn robust
representations. Given the limited availability of labeled date, achieving
robust representation learning becomes crucial. Inspired by Kolmogorov-Arnold
Networks (KANs), we propose Semi-KAN, which leverages the untapped potential of
KANs to enhance backbone architectures for representation learning in SSMIS.
Our findings indicate that: (1) compared to networks with fixed activation
functions, KANs exhibit superior representation learning capabilities with
fewer parameters, and (2) KANs excel in high-semantic feature spaces. Building
on these insights, we integrate KANs into tokenized intermediate
representations, applying them selectively at the encoder's bottleneck and the
decoder's top layers within a U-Net pipeline to extract high-level semantic
features. Although learnable activation functions improve feature expansion,
they introduce significant computational overhead with only marginal
performance gains. To mitigate this, we reduce the feature dimensions and
employ horizontal scaling to capture multiple pattern representations.
Furthermore, we design a multi-branch U-Net architecture with uncertainty
estimation to effectively learn diverse pattern representations. Extensive
experiments on four public datasets demonstrate that Semi-KAN surpasses
baseline networks, utilizing fewer KAN layers and lower computational cost,
thereby underscoring the potential of KANs as a promising approach for SSMIS.

Theory (MOST), extending its applicability to complex terrain and diverse

however, requires understanding the key drivers of turbulence anisotropy across
various terrain conditions. This study therefore employs random forest models
trained on measurement data from both flat and complex terrain and including
upstream terrain features, to predict turbulence anisotropy. Two approaches
were compared: using dimensional variables directly or employing
non-dimensional groups as model input. To address cross-correlation among
features, we developed a new selection method, Recursive Effect Elimination.
Finally, interpretability methods were used to identify the most influential
variables. Contrary to expectations, variables related to terrain influence
were not found to significantly impact turbulence anisotropy. Instead,
non-dimensional groups of common turbulence length, time and velocity scales
proved more robust than dimensional variables in isolating anisotropy drivers,
enhancing model performance over complex terrain and reducing location
dependence. A ratio of integral and turbulence memory length scales was found
to correlate well with turbulence anisotropy in both daytime and nighttime
conditions, both over flat and complex terrain. During the day, a refined
stability parameter incorporating both the surface and mixed layer scaling
emerged as the dominant driver of anisotropy, while at night, parameters
related to rapid distortion were strong predictors.

parameters. We find 50 new detections, seven of which are also planet candidate
host stars. We find excellent agreement between our $\nu_{\text{max}}$ and
$\Delta \nu$ measurements and literature values, with an average offset of $0.2
\pm 0.4\%$ ($\sigma=5\%$) and $0.2 \pm 0.7\%$ ($\sigma=2\%$), respectively. In
addition, we derive stellar radii and masses with an average precision of
$2.7\%$ and $10.4\%$, respectively, and find a median offset of $0.4 \pm 0.4\%$
($\sigma=10\%$) between our radii derived with asteroseismology and those from
Gaia parallaxes. Using spectroscopic $\log{R'_{\text{HK}}}$ activity
measurements from Keck/HIRES, we derive a new amplitude scaling relation with
an activity term for main-sequence and subgiant stars, which reduces the offset
between expected and observed oscillation amplitudes from $9.3 \pm 1.6\%$ to
$1.7 \pm 0.9\%$. Our work is the largest and most homogeneous asteroseismic
catalog of Kepler main-sequence and subgiant stars to date, including a total
of 101 stars hosting planet candidates and 451 stars with measured rotation
periods.

virial expansion of the internal energy in terms of the volume density. We
prove that the models, formulated for finite-size systems with $N$ particles,
are exactly solvable to any expansion order, as expectation values of physical
observables (e.g., volume density) are determined from solutions to nonlinear
C-integrable PDEs of hydrodynamic type. In the limit $N\to\infty$, phase
transitions emerge as classical shock waves in the space of thermodynamic
variables. Near critical points, we argue that the volume density exhibits a
scaling behavior consistent with the Universality Conjecture in viscous
transport PDEs. As an application, we employ our framework to nuclear matter
and construct a global QCD phase diagram revealing critical points for the
nuclear liquid-gas and hadron gas-QGP transitions. We demonstrate how
finite-size effects smear critical signatures, indicating the importance of
thoughtful considerations in the search for the QCD critical point.

measurements. However, its performance is significantly limited by noise. In
this work, we develop a quantum sensing protocol to estimate a parameter
$\theta$, associated with a magnetic field, under full-rank Markovian noise.
Our approach uses a probe state constructed from a CSS code that evolves under
the parameter's Hamiltonian for a short time, but without any active error
correction. Then we measure the code's $\hat{X}$ stabilizers to infer $\theta$.
Given $N$ copies of the probe state, we derive the probability that all
stabilizer measurements return $+1$, which depends on $\theta$. The uncertainty
in $\theta$ (estimated from these measurements) is bounded by a new quantity,
the Robustness Bound, which characterizes how the structure of the quantum code
affects the Quantum Fisher Information of the measurement. Using this bound, we
establish a strong no-go result: a nontrivial CSS code can achieve Heisenberg
scaling if and only if the Hamiltonian is orthogonal to the span of the noise
channel's Lindblad operators. This result extends the well-known HNLS condition
under infinite rounds of error correction to the robust quantum sensing setting
that does not use active error correction. Our finding suggests fundamental
limitations in the use of linear quantum codes for dephased magnetic field
sensing applications both in the near-term robust sensing regime and in the
long-term fault tolerant era.

lattice are independently initially occupied with probability $p$ or closed
with probability $q$. A site becomes occupied at a subsequent step if it is not
closed and has at least one occupied nearest neighbor in each of the two
coordinates. We study the final density of occupied sites when $p$ and $q$ are
both small. We show that this density approaches $0$ if $q\ge Cp^2/\log p^{-1}$
and $1$ if $q\le p^2/(\log p^{-1})^{1+o(1)}$. Thus we establish a logarithmic
correction in the critical scaling, which is known not to be present in the
standard model, settling a conjecture of Gravner and McDonald from 1997.

(quasi-)resonances in spherical symmetric heterogeneous Helmholtz problems with
piecewise smooth refractive index. Our focus lies in resonances very close to
the real axis, which characterize the so-called whispering gallery modes. Our
method involves a modal equation incorporating fundamental solutions to
decoupled problems, extending the known modal equation to the case of piecewise
smooth coefficients. We first establish the well-posedeness of the fundamental
system, then we formulate the problem of resonances as a nonlinear eigenvalue
problem, whose determinant will be the modal equation in the piecewise smooth
case. In combination with the numerical approximation of the fundamental
solutions using a spectral method, we derive a Newton method to solve the
nonlinear modal equation with a proper scaling. We show the local convergence
of the algorithm in the piecewise constant case by proving the simplicity of
the roots. We confirm our approach through a series of numerical experiments in
the piecewise constant and variable case.

propagate these bounds from the initial data along the Hartree-Fock flow to

raise critical questions about design sensitivity. Sensitivity questions are
especially critical in contexts, such as topology optimization, that yield
structures with emergent morphology. However, analyzing emergent structures via
conventional, perturbative techniques can mask larger-scale vulnerabilities
that could manifest in essential components. Risks that fail to appear in
perturbative sensitivity analyses will only continue to proliferate as topology
optimization-driven manufacturing penetrates more deeply into engineering
design and consumer products. Here, we introduce Laplace-transform based
computational filters that supplement computational morphogenesis with a set of
nonperturbative sensitivity analyses. We demonstrate how this approach
identifies important elements of a structure even in the absence of knowledge
of the ultimate, optimal structure itself. We leverage techniques from
molecular dynamics and implement these methods in open-source codes,
demonstrating their application to compliance minimization problems in both 2D
and 3D. Our implementation extends straightforwardly to topology optimization
for other problems and benefits from the strong scaling properties observed in
conventional molecular simulation.

  scalar",,,,,physics.flu-dyn,http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/,"  SQG describes the 2D active transport of a scalar field, such as temperature,
which -- when properly rescaled -- shares the same physical dimension of
length/time as the advecting velocity field. This duality has motivated
analogies with 3D turbulence. In particular, the Kraichnan-Leith-Batchelor
similarity theory predicts a Kolmogorov-type inertial range scaling $\propto
(\varepsilon \ell)^{1/3}$ for both scalar and velocity fields, and the presence
of intermittency was pointed out by Sukhatme & Pierrehumbert ($Chaos$
$\boldsymbol{12}$, 439, 2002) in unforced settings. In this work, we refine
these analogies using simulations up to $16,384^2$ collocation points in a
steady-state regime dominated by the direct cascade of scalar variance. We show
that mixed structure functions, linking velocity increments with powers of
scalar differences, exhibit clear scaling, revealing the role of anomalous
fluxes of all the scalar moments. However, the usual (unmixed) structure
functions do no follow any power-law scaling in any range of scales, neither
for the velocity nor for the scalar increments. This specific form of the
intermittency phenomenon reflects the specific kinematic properties of SQG
turbulence, involving the interplay between long-range interactions, structures
and geometry. Revealing the multiscaling in single-field statistics requires to
resort to generalised notions of scale invariance, such as extended
self-similarity and specific form of refined self-similarity. Our findings
emphasise the fundamental entanglement of scalar and velocity fields in SQG
turbulence: They evolve hand in hand and any attempt to isolate them destroys
scaling in its usual sense. This perspective sheds new lights on the
discrepancies in spectra and structure functions, that have been repeatedly
observed in SQG numerics for the past 20 years.

present in the system, such as global baryon conservation and volume
fluctuations. This hypothesis can be directly tested experimentally without the
need for corrections for volume fluctuations. We show that if correlations
among protons and antiprotons are driven by global baryon conservation and
volume fluctuations only, the equality $\hat{C}_{2}^{p} / \langle N_p \rangle^2
= \hat{C}_{2}^{\bar{p}} / \langle N_{\bar{p}} \rangle^2$ holds for large
systems created in central collisions. We point out that the experimental data
of the STAR Collaboration from phase I of RHIC beam energy scan are
approximately consistent with the scaling $\hat{C}_{nm}^{p,\bar{p}} \propto
\langle N_p \rangle^n \langle N_{\bar{p}} \rangle^m$, but the normalized
antiproton correlations are stronger than that of protons,
$-\hat{C}_{2}^{\bar{p}} / \langle N_{\bar{p}} \rangle^2 > -\hat{C}_{2}^{p} /

fluctuations alone cannot explain the data. We also discuss high-order
factorial cumulants which can be measured with sufficient precision within
phase II of RHIC-BES.
