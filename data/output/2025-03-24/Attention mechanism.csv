slot-timed, constant-capacity server, what short-run scheduling decisions must
be made to provide long-run service guarantees to competing flows of unit-sized
tasks? We model each flow's long-run guarantee as a worst-case service that
maps each queued arrival vector recording the flow's cumulative task arrivals,
including those initially queued, to a worst-case acceptable departure vector
lower-bounding its cumulative served tasks. We show that these maps are states
that can be updated as tasks arrive and are served, introduce state-based
scheduling, find the schedulability condition necessary and sufficient to
maintain all flows' long-run guarantees, and use this condition to identify all
short-run scheduling decisions that preserve schedulability. Our framework is
general but computationally complex. To reduce complexity, we consider three
specializations. First, we show that when satisfactory short-run scheduling
decisions exist, at least one can be efficiently identified by maximizing the
server's capacity slack, a generalization of the earliest-deadline-first rule.
Second, we show that a special class of worst-case services, min-plus services,
can be efficiently specified and updated using properties of the min-plus
algebra. Finally, we show that efficiency can be further improved by
restricting attention to a min-plus service subclass, dual-curve services. This
last specialization turns out to be a dynamic extension of service curves that
maintains all essential features of our framework while approaching near
practical viability.

hyperspectral images. It operates an optical encoder to compress the 3D data
into a 2D measurement and adopts a software decoder for the signal
reconstruction. Recently, a representative SCI set-up of coded aperture
snapshot compressive imager (CASSI) with Transformer reconstruction backend
remarks high-fidelity sensing performance. However, dominant spatial and
spectral attention designs show limitations in hyperspectral modeling. The
spatial attention values describe the inter-pixel correlation but overlook the
across-spectra variation within each pixel. The spectral attention size is
unscalable to the token spatial size and thus bottlenecks information
allocation. Besides, CASSI entangles the spatial and spectral information into
a 2D measurement, placing a barrier for information disentanglement and
modeling. In addition, CASSI blocks the light with a physical binary mask,
yielding the masked data loss. To tackle above challenges, we propose a
spatial-spectral (S2-) Transformer implemented by a paralleled attention design
and a mask-aware learning strategy. Firstly, we systematically explore pros and
cons of different spatial (-spectral) attention designs, based on which we find
performing both attentions in parallel well disentangles and models the blended
information. Secondly, the masked pixels induce higher prediction difficulty
and should be treated differently from unmasked ones. We adaptively prioritize
the loss penalty attributing to the mask structure by referring to the
mask-encoded prediction as an uncertainty estimator. We theoretically discuss
the distinct convergence tendencies between masked/unmasked regions of the
proposed learning strategy. Extensive experiments demonstrate that on average,
the results of the proposed method are superior over the state-of-the-art
method.

recover the 3D spatial-spectral signal from 2D measurement. Existing methods
for reconstructing Hyperspectral Image (HSI) typically involve learning
mappings from a 2D compressed image to a predetermined set of discrete spectral
bands. However, this approach overlooks the inherent continuity of the spectral
information. In this study, we propose an innovative method called
Spectral-wise Implicit Neural Representation (SINR) as a pioneering step toward
addressing this limitation. SINR introduces a continuous spectral amplification
process for HSI reconstruction, enabling spectral super-resolution with
customizable magnification factors. To achieve this, we leverage the concept of
implicit neural representation. Specifically, our approach introduces a
spectral-wise attention mechanism that treats individual channels as distinct
tokens, thereby capturing global spectral dependencies. Additionally, our
approach incorporates two components, namely a Fourier coordinate encoder and a
spectral scale factor module. The Fourier coordinate encoder enhances the
SINR's ability to emphasize high-frequency components, while the spectral scale
factor module guides the SINR to adapt to the variable number of spectral
channels. Notably, the SINR framework enhances the flexibility of CASSI
reconstruction by accommodating an unlimited number of spectral bands in the
desired output. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our SINR outperforms
baseline methods. By enabling continuous reconstruction within the CASSI
framework, we take the initial stride toward integrating implicit neural
representation into the field.

  Restoration","13 pages, 10 figures, conference or other essential info",,,,eess.IV cs.CV,http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/,"  Under-Display Camera (UDC) is an emerging technology that achieves
full-screen display via hiding the camera under the display panel. However, the
current implementation of UDC causes serious degradation. The incident light
required for camera imaging undergoes attenuation and diffraction when passing
through the display panel, leading to various artifacts in UDC imaging.
Presently, the prevailing UDC image restoration methods predominantly utilize
convolutional neural network architectures, whereas Transformer-based methods
have exhibited superior performance in the majority of image restoration tasks.
This is attributed to the Transformer's capability to sample global features
for the local reconstruction of images, thereby achieving high-quality image
restoration. In this paper, we observe that when using the Vision Transformer
for UDC degraded image restoration, the global attention samples a large amount
of redundant information and noise. Furthermore, compared to the ordinary
Transformer employing dense attention, the Transformer utilizing sparse
attention can alleviate the adverse impact of redundant information and noise.
Building upon this discovery, we propose a Segmentation Guided Sparse
Transformer method (SGSFormer) for the task of restoring high-quality images
from UDC degraded images. Specifically, we utilize sparse self-attention to
filter out redundant information and noise, directing the model's attention to
focus on the features more relevant to the degraded regions in need of
reconstruction. Moreover, we integrate the instance segmentation map as prior
information to guide the sparse self-attention in filtering and focusing on the
correct regions.

  Transaction on Audio Speech and Language Processing (TASLP)",,,,eess.AS cs.SD,http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/,"  Room acoustical parameters (RAPs), room geometrical parameters (RGPs) and
instantaneous occupancy level are essential metrics for parameterizing the room
acoustical characteristics (RACs) of a sound field around a listener's local
environment, offering comprehensive indications for various applications.
Current blind estimation methods either fail to cover a broad range of
real-world acoustic environments in the context of real background noise or
estimate only a few RAPs and RGPs from noisy single-channel speech signals. In
addition, they are limited in their ability to estimate the instantaneous
occupancy level. In this paper, we propose a new universal blind estimation
framework called the blind estimator of room parameters (BERP) to estimate
RAPs, RGPs and occupancy level via a unified methodology. It consists of two
modules: a unified room feature encoder that combines attention mechanisms with
convolutional layers to learn common features across room parameters, and
multiple separate parametric predictors for continuous estimation of each
parameter in parallel. The combination of attention and convolutions enables
the model to capture acoustic features locally and globally from speech,
yielding more robust and multitask generalizable common features. Separate
predictors allow the model to independently optimize for each room parameter to
reduce task learning conflict and improve per-task performance. This estimation
framework enables universal and efficient estimation of room parameters while
maintaining satisfactory performance. To evaluate the effectiveness of the
proposed framework, we compile a task-specific dataset from several publicly
available datasets, including synthetic and real reverberant recordings. The
results reveal that BERP achieves state-of-the-art (SOTA) performance and
excellent adaptability to real-world scenarios. The code and weights are

  Through the Lens of Model Architecture",This work has been accepted by Neural Networks,,,,cs.LG cs.AI,http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/,"  Neural models produce promising results when solving Vehicle Routing Problems
(VRPs), but often fall short in generalization. Recent attempts to enhance
model generalization often incur unnecessarily large training cost or cannot be
directly applied to other models solving different VRP variants. To address
these issues, we take a novel perspective on model architecture in this study.
Specifically, we propose a plug-and-play Entropy-based Scaling Factor (ESF) and
a Distribution-Specific (DS) decoder to enhance the size and distribution
generalization, respectively. ESF adjusts the attention weight pattern of the
model towards familiar ones discovered during training when solving VRPs of
varying sizes. The DS decoder explicitly models VRPs of multiple training
distribution patterns through multiple auxiliary light decoders, expanding the
model representation space to encompass a broader range of distributional
scenarios. We conduct extensive experiments on both synthetic and widely
recognized real-world benchmarking datasets and compare the performance with
seven baseline models. The results demonstrate the effectiveness of using ESF
and DS decoder to obtain a more generalizable model and showcase their
applicability to solve different VRP variants, i.e., travelling salesman
problem and capacitated VRP. Notably, our proposed generic components require
minimal computational resources, and can be effortlessly integrated into
conventional generalization strategies to further elevate model generalization.

shape encodings from multi-view images instead of point clouds. The choice of
multi-view images allows us to leverage 2D priors from off-the-shelf CLIP
models to facilitate fine-tuning with 3D data. Our approach not only shows
better generalization compared to existing point cloud methods, but also
reduces GPU requirements and training time. In addition, the model is modified
with cross-view attention to leverage information across multiple frames of the
object which further boosts performance. Notably, our model is permutation
invariant to the order of multi-view images while being pose-free. Compared to
the current SOTA point cloud method that requires 480 A100 hours to train 1
billion model parameters we only require 57 A5000 hours and 87 million
parameters. Multi-view images also provide more flexibility including being
able to encode objects with a variable number of images, and performance scales
when more views are used. In contrast, point cloud based methods require an
entire scan or model of the object. We showcase this flexibility with
benchmarks from images of real-world objects. Our model also achieves better
performance in more fine-grained text to shape retrieval, demonstrating better
text-and-shape alignment than point cloud based models.

tokenization method that produces an enriched representation of human motion
over time. This approach ensures that the transformer's attention mechanism
captures both spatial and temporal patterns simultaneously, rather than
focusing on only one aspect. The addition of the relative pose further
emphasizes subtle deviations from normal human movements. The architecture's
core, a novel Unified Encoder Twin Decoders (UETD) transformer, significantly
improves the detection of anomalous behaviors in video data. Extensive
evaluations across multiple benchmark datasets demonstrate that SPARTA
consistently outperforms existing methods, establishing a new state-of-the-art
in pose-based VAD.

undiagnosed, they cause neurological deficits, including cognitive impairment,
motor dysfunction, and sensory loss. As tumors grow, intracranial pressure
increases, potentially leading to fatal complications such as brain herniation.
Early diagnosis and treatment are crucial to controlling these effects and
slowing tumor progression. Deep learning (DL) and artificial intelligence (AI)
are increasingly used to assist doctors in early diagnosis through magnetic
resonance imaging (MRI) scans. Our research proposes targeted neural
architectures within multi-objective frameworks that can localize, segment, and
classify the grade of these gliomas from multimodal MRI images to solve this
critical issue. Our localization framework utilizes a targeted architecture
that enhances the LinkNet framework with an encoder inspired by VGG19 for
better multimodal feature extraction from the tumor along with spatial and
graph attention mechanisms that sharpen feature focus and inter-feature
relationships. For the segmentation objective, we deployed a specialized
framework using the SeResNet101 CNN model as the encoder backbone integrated
into the LinkNet architecture, achieving an IoU Score of 96%. The
classification objective is addressed through a distinct framework implemented
by combining the SeResNet152 feature extractor with Adaptive Boosting
classifier, reaching an accuracy of 98.53%. Our multi-objective approach with
targeted neural architectures demonstrated promising results for complete
glioma characterization, with the potential to advance medical AI by enabling
early diagnosis and providing more accurate treatment options for patients.

sequential recommendation (SR). Existing approaches predominantly rely on
implicit conditional diffusion models, which compress user behaviors into a
single representation during the forward diffusion process. While effective to
some extent, this oversimplification often leads to the loss of sequential and
contextual information, which is critical for understanding user behavior.
Moreover, explicit information, such as user-item interactions or sequential
patterns, remains underutilized, despite its potential to directly guide the
recommendation process and improve precision. However, combining implicit and
explicit information is non-trivial, as it requires dynamically integrating
these complementary signals while avoiding noise and irrelevant patterns within
user behaviors. To address these challenges, we propose Dual Conditional
Diffusion Models for Sequential Recommendation (DCRec), which effectively
integrates implicit and explicit information by embedding dual conditions into
both the forward and reverse diffusion processes. This allows the model to
retain valuable sequential and contextual information while leveraging explicit
user-item interactions to guide the recommendation process. Specifically, we
introduce the Dual Conditional Diffusion Transformer (DCDT), which employs a
cross-attention mechanism to dynamically integrate explicit signals throughout
the diffusion stages, ensuring contextual understanding and minimizing the
influence of irrelevant patterns. This design enables precise and contextually
relevant recommendations. Extensive experiments on public benchmark datasets
demonstrate that DCRec significantly outperforms state-of-the-art methods in
both accuracy and computational efficiency.

stochastic neurons with variable-length memory from their spiking activity. The
neuronal network is modeled by a stochastic system of interacting point
processes with variable-length memory. Each chain describes the activity of a
single neuron, indicating whether it spikes at a given time. One neuron's
influence on another can be either excitatory or inhibitory. To identify the
existence and nature of an interaction between a neuron and its postsynaptic
counterpart, we propose a model selection procedure based on the observation of
the spike activity of a finite set of neurons over a finite time. The proposed
procedure is also based on the maximum likelihood estimator for the synaptic
weight matrix of the network neuronal model. In this sense, we prove the
consistency of the maximum likelihood estimator {followed} by a proof of the
consistency of the neighborhood interaction estimation procedure. The
effectiveness of the proposed model selection procedure is demonstrated using
simulated data, which validates the underlying theory. The method is also
applied to analyze spike train data recorded from hippocampal neurons in rats
during a visual attention task, where a computational model reconstructs the
spiking activity and the results reveal interesting and biologically relevant

to significantly reduce the manual effort to obtain high quality semantic

We interpret the self-attention tensor as a Markov transition operator, which
enables us to iteratively construct a Markov chain. Pixel-wise counting of the
required number of iterations along the Markov chain to reach a relative
probability threshold yields a Markov-iteration-map, which we simply call a
Markov-map. Compared to the raw attention maps, we show that our proposed
Markov-map has less noise, sharper semantic boundaries and more uniform values
within semantically similar regions. We integrate the Markov-map in a simple

disentangled human bodies and garments from the given text prompts.
Specifically, we model each part (e.g., body, upper/lower clothes) of the
clothed human as one GS-enhanced mesh (GSM), which is a traditional mesh
attached with 2D Gaussians to better handle complicated textures (e.g., woolen,
translucent clothes) and produce realistic cloth animations. During the
generation, we first create the unclothed body, followed by a sequence of
individual cloth generation based on the body, where we introduce a
semantic-based algorithm to achieve better human-cloth and garment-garment
separation. To improve texture quality, we propose a view-consistent texture
refinement module, including a cross-view attention mechanism for texture style
consistency and an incident-angle-weighted denoising (IAW-DE) strategy to
update the appearance. Extensive experiments have demonstrated that DAGSM
generates high-quality disentangled avatars, supports clothing replacement and

inherent in dilation operation, in conjunction with self-attention mechanism,
to facilitate both multi-range attention (MA) and sparse multi-range attention
(SMA), enabling efficient capture of both regional and sparse global features.
Combined with local feature extraction, MAT adeptly capture dependencies across
various spatial ranges, improving the diversity and efficacy of its feature

the foundation while incorporating auxiliary modules for 2D and 3D keypoint

detection framework, while at the same time obviating the necessity of using
the left-right category as a prerequisite. Specifically, we propose an
interactive 2D-3D decoder, where 2D joint semantics is derived from detection
cues while 3D representation is lifted from those of 2D joints. Furthermore,
hierarchical attention is designed to enable the concurrent modeling of 2D
joints, 3D vertices, and camera translation. Consequently, we achieve an
end-to-end integration of hand detection, 2D pose estimation, and 3D mesh
reconstruction within a one-stage framework, so that the above multi-stage
drawbacks are overcome. Meanwhile, the HandOS reaches state-of-the-art

Recent tuning-free approaches address this by transferring local appearance via
implicit cross-image matching in the augmented self-attention mechanism of
pre-trained diffusion models. However, prior works are often restricted to
single-object cases or foreground object appearance transfer, struggling with
complex scenes involving multiple objects. To overcome this, we propose
AM-Adapter (Appearance Matching Adapter) to address exemplar-based semantic
image synthesis in-the-wild, enabling multi-object appearance transfer from a
single scene-level image. AM-Adapter automatically transfers local appearances
from the scene-level input. AM-Adapter alternatively provides controllability
to map user-defined object details to specific locations in the synthesized

introduce an automated exemplar retrieval method for selecting exemplar

transformers still fail to demonstrate sufficient nonlinear expressiveness
within a reasonable inference time. The lack of focus on key homonymous points
renders the representations of such methods vulnerable to challenging

computing speed is not conducive to the application. To overcome these
difficulties, we present the Hadamard Attention Recurrent Stereo Transformer
(HART) that incorporates the following components: 1) For faster inference, we
present a Hadamard product paradigm for the attention mechanism, achieving
linear computational complexity. 2) We designed a Dense Attention Kernel (DAK)
to amplify the differences between relevant and irrelevant feature responses.
This allows HART to focus on important details. DAK also converts zero elements
to non-zero elements to mitigate the reduced expressiveness caused by the
low-rank bottleneck. 3) To compensate for the spatial and channel interaction
missing in the Hadamard product, we propose MKOI to capture both global and

convolutions. Experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of our HART.

reimagining those worlds in a different style adds another layer of excitement.
Stylized worlds can also be used for downstream tasks where there is limited
training data and a need to expand a model's training distribution. Most
current novel-view synthesis stylization techniques lack the ability to
convincingly change geometry. This is because any geometry change requires
increased style strength which is often capped for stylization stability and
consistency. In this work, we propose a new autoregressive 3D Gaussian
Splatting stylization method. As part of this method, we contribute a new RGBD
diffusion model that allows for strength control over appearance and shape
stylization. To ensure consistency across stylized frames, we use a combination
of novel depth-guided cross attention, feature injection, and a Warp ControlNet
conditioned on composite frames for guiding the stylization of new frames. We
validate our method via extensive qualitative results, quantitative

popular for 3D object detection in autonomous driving. However, this paradigm
is constrained by the excessive feature compression. While some works explore
dense voxel fusion to enable better feature interaction, they face high
computational costs and challenges in query generation. Additionally, feature
misalignment in both domains results in suboptimal detection accuracy. To
address these limitations, we propose a Dual-Domain Homogeneous Fusion network
(DDHFusion), which leverages the complementarily of both BEV and voxel domains
while mitigating their drawbacks. Specifically, we first transform image
features into BEV and sparse voxel representations using lift-splat-shot and
our proposed Semantic-Aware Feature Sampling (SAFS) module. The latter
significantly reduces computational overhead by discarding unimportant voxels.
Next, we introduce Homogeneous Voxel and BEV Fusion (HVF and HBF) networks for
multi-modal fusion within respective domains. They are equipped with novel
cross-modal Mamba blocks to resolve feature misalignment and enable
comprehensive scene perception. The output voxel features are injected into the
BEV space to compensate for the information loss brought by direct height
compression. During query selection, the Progressive Query Generation (PQG)
mechanism is implemented in the BEV domain to reduce false negatives caused by
feature compression. Furthermore, we propose a Progressive Decoder (QD) that
sequentially aggregates not only context-rich BEV features but also
geometry-aware voxel features with deformable attention and the Multi-Modal
Voxel Feature Mixing (MMVFM) block for precise classification and box
regression.

is an essential component of graph representation learning. To efficiently
compress a given graph, graph pooling methods often drop their nodes with
attention-based scoring with the task loss. However, this often results in
simply removing nodes with lower degrees without consideration of their
feature-level relevance to the given task. To fix this problem, we propose a
Multi-View Pruning(MVP), a graph pruning method based on a multi-view framework
and reconstruction loss. Given a graph, MVP first constructs multiple graphs
for different views either by utilizing the predefined modalities or by
randomly partitioning the input features, to consider the importance of each
node in diverse perspectives. Then, it learns the score for each node by
considering both the reconstruction and the task loss. MVP can be incorporated
with any hierarchical pooling framework to score the nodes. We validate MVP on
multiple benchmark datasets by coupling it with two graph pooling methods, and
show that it significantly improves the performance of the base graph pooling
method, outperforming all baselines. Further analysis shows that both the
encoding of multiple views and the consideration of reconstruction loss are the
key to the success of MVP, and that it indeed identifies nodes that are less
important according to domain knowledge.

diagnostic decisions significantly impact patient outcomes. Conventional deep
learning models tend to produce overconfident predictions despite underlying
uncertainties, potentially leading to misdiagnoses. Attention mechanisms have
emerged as powerful tools in deep learning, enabling models to focus on

effective in addressing uncertainty challenges. Cross-attention has become
increasingly important in medical image analysis for capturing dependencies
across features and modalities. This paper proposes a novel dual
cross-attention fusion model for medical image analysis by addressing key
challenges in feature integration and interpretability. Our approach introduces
a bidirectional cross-attention mechanism with refined channel and spatial
attention that dynamically fuses feature maps from EfficientNetB4 and ResNet34
leveraging multi-network contextual dependencies. The refined features through
channel and spatial attention highlights discriminative patterns crucial for
accurate classification. The proposed model achieved AUC of 99.75%, 100%,
99.93% and 98.69% and AUPR of 99.81%, 100%, 99.97%, and 96.36% on Covid-19,
Tuberculosis, Pneumonia Chest X-ray images and Retinal OCT images respectively.
The entropy values and several high uncertain samples give an interpretable
visualization from the model enhancing transparency. By combining multi-scale
feature extraction, bidirectional attention and uncertainty estimation, our
proposed model strongly impacts medical image analysis.

in-context learning on linear data. Through extensive empirical experiments and
rigorous theoretical analysis, we demystify the emergence of elegant attention
patterns: a diagonal and homogeneous pattern in the key-query (KQ) weights, and
a last-entry-only and zero-sum pattern in the output-value (OV) weights.
Remarkably, these patterns consistently appear from gradient-based training
starting from random initialization. Our analysis reveals that such emergent
structures enable multi-head attention to approximately implement a debiased
gradient descent predictor -- one that outperforms single-head attention and
nearly achieves Bayesian optimality up to proportional factor. Furthermore,
compared to linear transformers, the softmax attention readily generalizes to
sequences longer than those seen during training. We also extend our study to
scenarios with non-isotropic covariates and multi-task linear regression. In
the former, multi-head attention learns to implement a form of pre-conditioned
gradient descent. In the latter, we uncover an intriguing regime where the
interplay between head number and task number triggers a superposition
phenomenon that efficiently resolves multi-task in-context learning. Our
results reveal that in-context learning ability emerges from the trained
transformer as an aggregated effect of its architecture and the underlying data

recent research has expanded from single image generation to transparent layer

inconsistent inter-layer interactions, such as occlusion relationships, spatial
layout, and shadowing. In this paper, we introduce DreamLayer, a novel
framework that enables coherent text-driven generation of multiple image
layers, by explicitly modeling the relationship between transparent foreground

Context-Aware Cross-Attention (CACA) for global-local information exchange,
Layer-Shared Self-Attention (LSSA) for establishing robust inter-layer
connections, and Information Retained Harmonization (IRH) for refining fusion
details at the latent level. By leveraging a coherent full-image context,
DreamLayer builds inter-layer connections through attention mechanisms and
applies a harmonization step to achieve seamless layer fusion. To facilitate
research in multi-layer generation, we construct a high-quality, diverse
multi-layer dataset including 400k samples. Extensive experiments and user
studies demonstrate that DreamLayer generates more coherent and well-aligned
layers, with broad applicability, including latent-space image editing and

  Alignment",Accepted by CVPR2025,,,,cs.SD cs.CV,http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/,"  Accurately localizing audible objects based on audio-visual cues is the core
objective of audio-visual segmentation. Most previous methods emphasize spatial
or temporal multi-modal modeling, yet overlook challenges from ambiguous
audio-visual correspondences such as nearby visually similar but acoustically
different objects and frequent shifts in objects' sounding status.
Consequently, they may struggle to reliably correlate audio and visual cues,
leading to over- or under-segmentation. To address these limitations, we
propose a novel framework with two primary components: an audio-guided modality
alignment (AMA) module and an uncertainty estimation (UE) module. Instead of
indiscriminately correlating audio-visual cues through a global attention
mechanism, AMA performs audio-visual interactions within multiple groups and
consolidates group features into compact representations based on their
responsiveness to audio cues, effectively directing the model's attention to
audio-relevant areas. Leveraging contrastive learning, AMA further
distinguishes sounding regions from silent areas by treating features with
strong audio responses as positive samples and weaker responses as negatives.
Additionally, UE integrates spatial and temporal information to identify
high-uncertainty regions caused by frequent changes in sound state, reducing
prediction errors by lowering confidence in these areas. Experimental results
demonstrate that our approach achieves superior accuracy compared to existing
state-of-the-art methods, particularly in challenging scenarios where
traditional approaches struggle to maintain reliable segmentation.

  Text-to-Image Models",11 pages,,,,cs.CV,http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/,"  Image-conditioned generation methods, such as depth- and canny-conditioned
approaches, have demonstrated remarkable abilities for precise image synthesis.
However, existing models still struggle to accurately control the content of
multiple instances (or regions). Even state-of-the-art models like FLUX and
3DIS face challenges, such as attribute leakage between instances, which limits
user control. To address these issues, we introduce DreamRenderer, a
training-free approach built upon the FLUX model. DreamRenderer enables users
to control the content of each instance via bounding boxes or masks, while
ensuring overall visual harmony. We propose two key innovations: 1) Bridge
Image Tokens for Hard Text Attribute Binding, which uses replicated image
tokens as bridge tokens to ensure that T5 text embeddings, pre-trained solely
on text data, bind the correct visual attributes for each instance during Joint
Attention; 2) Hard Image Attribute Binding applied only to vital layers.
Through our analysis of FLUX, we identify the critical layers responsible for
instance attribute rendering and apply Hard Image Attribute Binding only in
these layers, using soft binding in the others. This approach ensures precise
control while preserving image quality. Evaluations on the COCO-POS and
COCO-MIG benchmarks demonstrate that DreamRenderer improves the Image Success
Ratio by 17.7% over FLUX and enhances the performance of layout-to-image models
like GLIGEN and 3DIS by up to 26.8%. Project Page:

interactions in structured data, making them particularly suitable for
applications such as trajectory prediction and mesh processing. However,
existing simplicial neural networks (SNNs), whether convolutional or
attention-based, rely primarily on discrete filtering techniques, which can be
restrictive. In contrast, partial differential equations (PDEs) on simplicial
complexes offer a principled approach to capture continuous dynamics in such
structures. In this work, we introduce COntinuous SiMplicial neural netwOrkS
(COSMOS), a novel SNN architecture derived from PDEs on simplicial complexes.
We provide theoretical and experimental justifications of COSMOS's stability
under simplicial perturbations. Furthermore, we investigate the over-smoothing
phenomenon, a common issue in geometric deep learning, demonstrating that
COSMOS offers better control over this effect than discrete SNNs. Our
experiments on real-world datasets of ocean trajectory prediction and
regression on partial deformable shapes demonstrate that COSMOS achieves
competitive performance compared to state-of-the-art SNNs in complex and noisy
environments.

  Spatiotemporal Diffusion for Audio-driven Talking Portrait",,,,,cs.CV,http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-nd/4.0/,"  Audio-driven single-image talking portrait generation plays a crucial role in
virtual reality, digital human creation, and filmmaking. Existing approaches
are generally categorized into keypoint-based and image-based methods.
Keypoint-based methods effectively preserve character identity but struggle to
capture fine facial details due to the fixed points limitation of the 3D
Morphable Model. Moreover, traditional generative networks face challenges in
establishing causality between audio and keypoints on limited datasets,
resulting in low pose diversity. In contrast, image-based approaches produce
high-quality portraits with diverse details using the diffusion network but
incur identity distortion and expensive computational costs. In this work, we
propose KDTalker, the first framework to combine unsupervised implicit 3D
keypoint with a spatiotemporal diffusion model. Leveraging unsupervised
implicit 3D keypoints, KDTalker adapts facial information densities, allowing
the diffusion process to model diverse head poses and capture fine facial
details flexibly. The custom-designed spatiotemporal attention mechanism
ensures accurate lip synchronization, producing temporally consistent,
high-quality animations while enhancing computational efficiency. Experimental

features while leveraging a simple attention mechanism for adaptivity. The
latter encodes local features, mixes channel information, and ensures no
additional computational burden during inference through reparameterization.
This approach effectively resolves the limitations of existing lightweight

capabilities of large language models (LLMs), the ability to process multiple
potentially entangled or conflicting instructions remains a considerable
challenge. Real-world scenarios often require consistency across multiple
instructions over time, such as secret privacy, personal preferences, and
prioritization, which demand sophisticated abilities to integrate multiple
turns and carefully balance competing objectives when instructions intersect or
conflict. This work presents a systematic investigation of LLMs' capabilities
in handling multiple turns of instructions, covering three levels of
difficulty: (1) retrieving information from instructions, (2) tracking and
reasoning across turns, and (3) resolving conflicts among instructions. We
construct MultiTurnInstruct with around 1.1K high-quality multi-turn
conversations through the human-in-the-loop approach and result in nine
capability categories, including statics and dynamics, reasoning, and
multitasking. Our finding reveals an intriguing trade-off between different
capabilities. While GPT models demonstrate superior memorization, they show
reduced effectiveness in privacy-protection tasks requiring selective
information withholding. Larger models exhibit stronger reasoning capabilities
but still struggle with resolving conflicting instructions. Importantly, these
performance gaps cannot be attributed solely to information loss, as models
demonstrate strong BLEU scores on memorization tasks but their attention
mechanisms fail to integrate multiple related instructions effectively. These
findings highlight critical areas for improvement in complex real-world tasks
involving multi-turn instructions.

to significant feature distribution discrepancies between synthetic and real
target domains, leading to performance degradation. To address this issue, we
propose Discriminative Domain Reassembly and Soft-Fusion (DRSF), a training

LDMs to produce diverse pseudo-target domain samples and introduce two key
modules to handle distribution bias. First, Discriminative Feature Decoupling

channel-level features, suppressing synthetic noise while preserving semantic
consistency. Second, Multi-pseudo-domain Soft Fusion (MDSF) module uses
adversarial training with latent-space feature interpolation, creating
continuous feature transitions between domains. Extensive SDG experiments on

substantial performance gains with only marginal computational overhead.
Notably, DRSF's plug-and-play architecture enables seamless integration with

existing schemes, operating exclusively in the compressed video domain and
exploiting all freely available modalities, i.e., I-frames, and P-frames

methods approach this task as a naive multi-modality problem, ignoring the
temporal correlation and implicit sparsity across P-frames for modeling
stronger shared representations for videos of the same action, making training

video understanding backbones, we increase inference speed by a factor of $56$

mechanism with existing attention-based network structures, which can achieve
improved spatial feature fusion, cross-scale information aggregation, and more
importantly, much faster inference. We have evaluated the C2D-ISR framework

  Engineering",,,,,cs.CV cs.AI,http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-nd/4.0/,"  Accurate segmentation is essential for effective treatment planning and
disease monitoring. Existing medical image segmentation methods predominantly
rely on uni-modal visual inputs, such as images or videos, requiring
labor-intensive manual annotations. Additionally, medical imaging techniques
capture multiple intertwined organs within a single scan, further complicating
segmentation accuracy. To address these challenges, MedSAM, a large-scale
medical segmentation model based on the Segment Anything Model (SAM), was
developed to enhance segmentation accuracy by integrating image features with
user-provided prompts. While MedSAM has demonstrated strong performance across
various medical segmentation tasks, it primarily relies on geometric prompts
(e.g., points and bounding boxes) and lacks support for text-based prompts,
which could help specify subtle or ambiguous anatomical structures. To overcome
these limitations, we propose the Organ-aware Multi-scale Text-guided Medical
Image Segmentation Model (OMT-SAM) for multi-organ segmentation. Our approach
introduces CLIP encoders as a novel image-text prompt encoder, operating with
the geometric prompt encoder to provide informative contextual guidance. We
pair descriptive textual prompts with corresponding images, processing them
through pre-trained CLIP encoders and a cross-attention mechanism to generate
fused image-text embeddings. Additionally, we extract multi-scale visual
features from MedSAM, capturing fine-grained anatomical details at different
levels of granularity. We evaluate OMT-SAM on the FLARE 2021 dataset,
benchmarking its performance against existing segmentation methods. Empirical
results demonstrate that OMT-SAM achieves a mean Dice Similarity Coefficient of
0.937, outperforming MedSAM (0.893) and other segmentation models, highlighting
its superior capability in handling complex medical image segmentation tasks.

HRFM-TOD effectively mitigates the feature dilution problem encountered in
conventional PANet frameworks, thereby enhancing both detection accuracy and

multiple receptive fields in both channel and spatial dimensions, significantly
improving the model's information extraction capabilities. Finally, we propose
the Prior-Guided Enhancement Module (PGFE) to tackle common image quality

enhance visibility, substantially boosting detection performance. To support
this research, we construct a novel dataset, the Chinese Nighttime Traffic Sign

yields precise correspondence prediction through three core designs. Firstly,
We endow the point-wise feature extraction with SO(3)-invariance, which
facilitates robust mapping between camera coordinate space and object
coordinate space regardless of rotation transformation. Secondly, the spherical

spherical anchors from a comprehensive perspective, thus mitigating the

information to boost restoration. To enhance the integration of the parser
within IRNet, we propose Intra Parser-Prompted Attention (IntraPPA) and Inter

parser features to facilitate restoration. The IntraPPA re-considers cross
attention between parser and restoration features, enabling implicit perception

followed by formulating these fused features within an attention mechanism to
explicitly perceive parser information. Further, we propose a parser-prompted

that includes nearly a decade of remote sensing data from California, U.S.,
these models predict the spread of wildfires for the following day. Through
detailed quantitative comparison analysis, we discovered that Transformer-based

remain fixed, leading to minimal contributions from later decoder layers,
thereby limiting performance improvement. Recently, State Space Models (SSM)
have shown efficient context modeling ability with linear complexity through
iterative interactions between system states and inputs. Inspired by SSMs, we
propose a new 3D object DEtection paradigm with an interactive STate space
model (DEST). In the interactive SSM, we design a novel state-dependent SSM
parameterization method that enables system states to effectively serve as
queries in 3D indoor detection tasks. In addition, we introduce four key
designs tailored to the characteristics of point cloud and SSM: The
serialization and bidirectional scanning strategies enable bidirectional
feature interaction among scene points within the SSM. The inter-state
attention mechanism models the relationships between state points, while the
gated feed-forward network enhances inter-channel correlations. To the best of
our knowledge, this is the first method to model queries as system states and
scene points as system inputs, which can simultaneously update scene point
features and query features with linear complexity. Extensive experiments on
two challenging datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of our DEST-based

recognition tasks. However, existing visual explanation methods can not display
the attention flow hidden inside the inner structure of ViT models, which
explains how the final attention regions are formed inside a ViT for its
decision-making. In this paper, a novel visual explanation approach, Dynamic
Accumulated Attention Map (DAAM), is proposed to provide a tool that can
visualize, for the first time, the attention flow from the top to the bottom
through ViT networks. To this end, a novel decomposition module is proposed to
construct and store the spatial feature information by unlocking the [class]
token generated by the self-attention module of each ViT block. The module can
also obtain the channel importance coefficients by decomposing the
classification score for supervised ViT models. Because of the lack of
classification score in self-supervised ViT models, we propose dimension-wise
importance weights to compute the channel importance coefficients. Such spatial
features are linearly combined with the corresponding channel importance
coefficients, forming the attention map for each block. The dynamic attention
flow is revealed by block-wisely accumulating each attention map. The
contribution of this work focuses on visualizing the evolution dynamic of the
decision-making attention for any intermediate block inside a ViT model by
proposing a novel decomposition module and dimension-wise importance weights.
The quantitative and qualitative analysis consistently validate the
effectiveness and superior capacity of the proposed DAAM for not only
interpreting ViT models with the fully-connected layers as the classifier but
also self-supervised ViT models. The code is available at

of classifying remote sensing images with limited labeled samples. Existing
methods typically emphasize single-modal feature learning, neglecting the
potential benefits of optimizing multi-modal representations. To address this

framework aimed at constructing an ideal Platonic representational space
through optimal transport (OT) theory. This framework seeks to harmonize rich
visual information with less dense textual cues, enabling effective cross-modal
information transfer and complementarity. Central to this approach is the
Optimal Transport Adapter (OTA), which employs a cross-modal attention
mechanism to enrich textual representations and facilitate subsequent better
information interaction. By transforming the network optimization into an OT
optimization problem, OTA establishes efficient pathways for balanced
information exchange between modalities. Moreover, we introduce a sample-level
Entropy-Aware Weighted (EAW) loss, which combines difficulty-weighted
similarity scores with entropy-based regularization. This loss function
provides finer control over the OT optimization process, enhancing its
solvability and stability. Our framework offers a scalable and efficient

image sequences into a single output while preserving as much information as
possible from the input. However, existing methods face several significant
limitations: 1) requiring task- or dataset-specific models; 2) neglecting
real-world image degradations (\textit{e.g.}, noise), which causes failure when
processing degraded inputs; 3) operating in pixel space, where attention
mechanisms are computationally expensive; and 4) lacking user interaction
capabilities. To address these challenges, we propose a unified framework for
multi-task, multi-degradation, and language-guided image fusion. Our framework
includes two key components: 1) a practical degradation pipeline that simulates
real-world image degradations and generates interactive prompts to guide the
model; 2) an all-in-one Diffusion Transformer (DiT) operating in latent space,
which fuses a clean image conditioned on both the degraded inputs and the

motions that are critical for distinguishing fine-grained actions. Recent work
leverages a unified graph representation that combines body, hand, and foot
keypoints to capture detailed body dynamics. Yet, these models often blur fine
hand details due to the disparity between body and hand action characteristics
and the loss of subtle features during the spatial-pooling. In this paper, we
propose BHaRNet (Body-Hand action Recognition Network), a novel framework that
augments a typical body-expert model with a hand-expert model. Our model
jointly trains both streams with an ensemble loss that fosters cooperative

and a pooling-attention module to enable feature-level interactions and
selectively fuse complementary information. Inspired by MMNet, we also

to real-world datasets. This success can be attributed to pretrained
non-object-centric foundation models, whose features serve as reconstruction
targets for slot attention. However, targets must remain frozen throughout the
training, which sets an upper bound on the performance object-centric models
can attain. Attempts to update the target encoder by bootstrapping result in
large performance drops, which can be attributed to its lack of object-centric
inductive biases, causing the object-centric model's encoder to drift away from
representations useful as reconstruction targets. To address these limitations,
we propose Object-CEntric Pretraining by Target Encoder BOotstrapping, a
self-distillation setup for training object-centric models from scratch, on
real-world data, for the first time ever. In OCEBO, the target encoder is
updated as an exponential moving average of the object-centric model, thus
explicitly being enriched with object-centric inductive biases introduced by
slot attention while removing the upper bound on performance present in other
models. We mitigate the slot collapse caused by random initialization of the
target encoder by introducing a novel cross-view patch filtering approach that
limits the supervision to sufficiently informative patches. When pretrained on
241k images from COCO, OCEBO achieves unsupervised object discovery performance
comparable to that of object-centric models with frozen non-object-centric
target encoders pretrained on hundreds of millions of images. The code and

practical scenarios, transferable adversarial examples on ViTs have been
extensively studied. A typical approach to improving adversarial
transferability is by refining the surrogate model. However, existing work on
ViTs has restricted their surrogate refinement to backward propagation. In this
work, we instead focus on Forward Propagation Refinement (FPR) and specifically
refine two key modules of ViTs: attention maps and token embeddings. For
attention maps, we propose Attention Map Diversification (AMD), which
diversifies certain attention maps and also implicitly imposes beneficial
gradient vanishing during backward propagation. For token embeddings, we
propose Momentum Token Embedding (MTE), which accumulates historical token
embeddings to stabilize the forward updates in both the Attention and MLP
blocks. We conduct extensive experiments with adversarial examples transferred
from ViTs to various CNNs and ViTs, demonstrating that our FPR outperforms the
current best (backward) surrogate refinement by up to 7.0\% on average. We also
validate its superiority against popular defenses and its compatibility with
other transfer methods. Codes and appendix are available at

mitigation method for large language models (LLMs). Modern AI systems such as
LLMs are expanding into sensitive social contexts where fairness concerns
become especially crucial. Since LLMs develop decision-making patterns by
training on massive datasets of human-generated content, they naturally encode
and perpetuate societal biases. While modifying training datasets and
algorithms is expensive and requires significant resources; post-processing
techniques-such as selectively deactivating neurons and attention heads in
pre-trained LLMs-can provide feasible and effective approaches to improve
fairness. However, identifying the optimal subset of parameters to prune
presents a combinatorial challenge within LLMs' immense parameter space,
requiring solutions that efficiently balance competing objectives across the
frontiers of model fairness and utility.
  To address the computational challenges, we explore a search-based program
repair approach via randomized simulated annealing. Given the prohibitive
evaluation costs in billion-parameter LLMs, we develop surrogate deep neural
networks that efficiently model the relationship between attention head states
(active/inactive) and their corresponding fairness/utility metrics. This allows
us to perform optimization over the surrogate models and efficiently identify
optimal subsets of attention heads for selective pruning rather than directly
searching through the LLM parameter space. This paper introduces Attention
Pruning, a fairness-aware surrogate simulated annealing approach to prune
attention heads in LLMs that disproportionately contribute to bias while
minimally impacting overall model utility. Our experiments show that Attention

has yielded insights into cognitive processes. In this study, we utilized an
instructionless paradigm to collect eye movement data from 21 participants,
examining two FER processes: free viewing and grounded FER. We analyzed
fixational, pupillary, and microsaccadic events from eye movements,
establishing their correlation with emotion perception and performance in the
grounded task. By identifying regions of interest on the face, we explored the
impact of eye-gaze strategies on face processing, their connection to emotions,
and performance in emotion perception. During free viewing, participants
displayed specific attention patterns for various emotions. In grounded tasks,
where emotions were interpreted based on words, we assessed performance and
contextual understanding. Notably, gaze patterns during free viewing predicted
success in grounded FER tasks, underscoring the significance of initial gaze
behavior. We also employed features from pre-trained deep-learning models for
face recognition to enhance the scalability and comparability of attention
analysis during free viewing across different datasets and populations. This
method facilitated the prediction and modeling of individual emotion perception
performance from minimal observations. Our findings advance the understanding

challenging due to limited labeled video data and high training costs. Recent
video prompting methods attempt to adapt CLIP for video tasks by introducing
learnable prompts, but they typically rely on a single static prompt for all
video sequences, overlooking the diverse temporal dynamics and spatial
variations that exist across frames. This limitation significantly hinders the

dynamic Prompting (STOP) model which consists of two complementary modules, the
intra-frame spatial prompting and inter-frame temporal prompting. Our
intra-frame spatial prompts are designed to adaptively highlight discriminative
regions within each frame by leveraging intra-frame attention and temporal

dynamics and capture fine-grained spatial details. Additionally, to highlight
the varying importance of frames for video understanding, we further introduce
inter-frame temporal prompts, dynamically inserting prompts between frames with
high temporal variance as measured by frame similarity. This enables the model
to prioritize key frames and enhances its capacity to understand temporal

computational overhead resulting from massive video frames, often alleviated

we propose the Hybrid-level Instruction Injection Strategy for Conditional
Token Compression in MLLMs (HICom), utilizing the instruction as a condition to
guide the compression from both local and global levels. This encourages the
compression to retain the maximum amount of user-focused information while
reducing visual tokens to minimize computational burden. Specifically, the
instruction condition is injected into the grouped visual tokens at the local
level and the learnable tokens at the global level, and we conduct the
attention mechanism to complete the conditional compression. From the
hybrid-level compression, the instruction-relevant visual parts are highlighted
while the temporal-spatial structure is also preserved for easier understanding
of LLMs. To further unleash the potential of HICom, we introduce a new
conditional pre-training stage with our proposed dataset HICom-248K.

Our extensive experiments show that SGGLC-Net achieves competitive PSNR and

experiments demonstrate significant performance gain by SV4D 2.0 both visually
and quantitatively, achieving better detail (-14\% LPIPS) and 4D consistency
(-44\% FV4D) in novel-view video synthesis and 4D optimization (-12\% LPIPS and
-24\% FV4D) compared to SV4D. Project page: https://sv4d2.0.github.io.

  https://github.com/MaureenZOU/m3-spatial",,,,cs.CV cs.RO,http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/,"  We present 3D Spatial MultiModal Memory (M3), a multimodal memory system
designed to retain information about medium-sized static scenes through video
sources for visual perception. By integrating 3D Gaussian Splatting techniques
with foundation models, M3 builds a multimodal memory capable of rendering
feature representations across granularities, encompassing a wide range of
knowledge. In our exploration, we identify two key challenges in previous works
on feature splatting: (1) computational constraints in storing high-dimensional
features for each Gaussian primitive, and (2) misalignment or information loss
between distilled features and foundation model features. To address these
challenges, we propose M3 with key components of principal scene components and
Gaussian memory attention, enabling efficient training and inference. To
validate M3, we conduct comprehensive quantitative evaluations of feature
similarity and downstream tasks, as well as qualitative visualizations to
highlight the pixel trace of Gaussian memory attention. Our approach
encompasses a diverse range of foundation models, including vision-language
models (VLMs), perception models, and large multimodal and language models
(LMMs/LLMs). Furthermore, to demonstrate real-world applicability, we deploy
M3's feature field in indoor scenes on a quadruped robot. Notably, we claim
that M3 is the first work to address the core compression challenges in 3D
feature distillation.

  Zhenwei Shi","DynamicVis: An Efficient and General Visual Foundation Model for Remote
  Sensing Image Understanding",,,,,cs.CV,http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/,"  The advancement of remote sensing technology has improved the spatial
resolution of satellite imagery, facilitating more detailed visual
representations for diverse interpretations. However, existing methods exhibit
limited generalization capabilities across varied applications. While some
contemporary foundation models demonstrate potential, they are hindered by
insufficient cross-task adaptability and primarily process low-resolution
imagery of restricted sizes, thus failing to fully exploit high-resolution data
or leverage comprehensive large-scene semantics. Crucially, remote sensing
imagery differs fundamentally from natural images, as key foreground targets
(eg., maritime objects, artificial structures) often occupy minimal spatial
proportions (~1%) and exhibit sparse distributions. Efficiently modeling
cross-task generalizable knowledge from lengthy 2D tokens (~100,000) poses a
significant challenge yet remains critical for remote sensing image
understanding. Motivated by the selective attention mechanisms inherent to the
human visual system, we propose DynamicVis, a dynamic visual perception
foundation model for remote sensing imagery. The framework integrates a novel
dynamic region perception backbone based on the selective state space model,
which strategically balances localized detail extraction with global contextual
integration, enabling computationally efficient encoding of large-scale data
while maintaining architectural scalability. To enhance cross-task knowledge
transferring, we introduce a multi-instance learning paradigm utilizing
meta-embedding representations, trained on million-scale region-level
annotations. Evaluations across nine downstream tasks demonstrate the model's
versatility. DynamicVis achieves multi-level feature modeling with exceptional
efficiency, processing (2048x2048) pixels with 97 ms latency (6% of ViT's) and
833 MB GPU memory (3% of ViT's).
