from complex data distributions. Despite their empirical success in various
machine learning tasks, significant gaps remain in understanding their
theoretical properties, particularly regarding convergence guarantees. This
paper aims to bridge that gap by providing non-asymptotic convergence
guarantees for VAE trained using both Stochastic Gradient Descent and Adam
algorithms.We derive a convergence rate of $\mathcal{O}(\log n / \sqrt{n})$,
where $n$ is the number of iterations of the optimization algorithm, with
explicit dependencies on the batch size, the number of variational samples, and
other key hyperparameters. Our theoretical analysis applies to both Linear VAE
and Deep Gaussian VAE, as well as several VAE variants, including $\beta$-VAE
and IWAE. Additionally, we empirically illustrate the impact of hyperparameters
on convergence, offering new insights into the theoretical understanding of VAE
training.

$\mathscr{D}=(d_1,d_2,\dots,d_n)$. The examination of topological indices on
trees gives us a general overview through bounds to find the maximum and
minimum bounds which reflect the maximum and minimum number of edges incident
to every vertex in the graph, Albertson index known as $\sum_{uv\in E(G)}\lvert
d_u(G)-d_v(G) \rvert$, Sigma index $\sigma(G)$ among $\mathscr{D}$ of tree $T$
when $d_n\geqslant \dots \geqslant d_1$. According to the first zegrb we show
for a degree sequence of order $n=4$,
$\operatorname{irr}(T)=M_1(T)^2-2\sqrt{M_1(T)}+\sum_{i=1}^4\left|x_i-x_{i+1}\right|-(b+c)-1$.

  paraelectric-metaparaelectric phase transition","18 pages, 5 figures",,,,cond-mat.mtrl-sci physics.comp-ph,http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/,"  Electrostatic dielectric capacitors are foundational to advance the
electronics and electric power devices due to their ultrafast
charging/discharging capability and high-power density. However, the low energy
density limits the potential for next generation devices in terms of
miniaturization and integration. We propose a strategy that relies on inducing
a field-driven phase transition that we denote paraelectric-metaparaelectric,
which yields an ultrahigh energy density in III-nitrides. III-nitride compounds
(Al, Sc, B)N with certain cation concentrations possess a nonpolar hexagonal
ground phase which could transform into a polar wurtzite phase under a very
large electric field, which is denoted as metaparaelectric with nearly null
hysteresis P-E loop. This paraelectric-metaparaelectric transition leads to a
polarization saturation at large electric field. The corresponding P-E loop
displays a giant energy density of 308 J/cm$^3$ with high efficiency nearly
100%. The proposed paraelectric-metaparaelectric phase transition strategy in
nitrides opens an avenue to design of next generation high performance
dielectrics.

  modelling","18 pages, 9 figures",,,,cond-mat.mtrl-sci physics.app-ph physics.comp-ph,http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/,"  We study the thermodynamics and phase stability of the AlTiVNb and AlTiCrMo
refractory high-entropy superalloys using a combination of \textit{ab initio}
electronic structure theory -- namely a concentration wave analysis -- and
atomistic Monte Carlo simulations. Our multiscale approach is suitable both for
examining atomic short-range order in the solid solution, as well as for
studying the emergence of long-range crystallographic order with decreasing
temperature. In both alloys considered in this work, in alignment with
experimental observations, we predict a B2 (CsCl) chemical ordering emerging at
high temperatures, which is driven primarily by Al and Ti, with other elements
expressing weaker site preferences. The predicted B2 ordering temperature for
AlTiVNb is higher than that for AlTiCrMo. These chemical orderings are
discussed in terms of the alloys' electronic structure, with hybridisation
between the $sp$ states of Al and the $d$ states of the transition metals
understood to play an important role. Within our modelling, the chemically
ordered B2 phases for both alloys have an increased predicted residual
resistivity compared to the A2 (disordered bcc) phases. These increased
resistivity values are understood to originate in a reduction in the electronic
density of states at the Fermi level, in conjunction with qualitative changes
to the alloys' smeared-out Fermi surfaces. These results highlight the close
connections between composition, structure, and physical properties in this
technologically relevant class of materials.

preparation problem is proposed, facing a challenge of fundamental importance
in many topic areas of quantum computing. The algorithm uses a variational
quantum circuit based on the Standard Recursive Block Basis (SRBB), a
hierarchical construction for the matrix algebra of the $SU(2^n)$ group, which
is capable of linking the variational parameters with the topology of the Lie
group. Compared to the full algebra, using only diagonal components reduces the
number of CNOTs by an exponential factor, as well as the circuit depth, in full
agreement with the relaxation principle, inherent to the approximation
methodology, of minimizing resources while achieving high accuracy. The desired
quantum state is then approximated by a scalable quantum neural network, which
is designed upon the diagonal SRBB sub-algebra. This approach provides a new
scheme for approximate quantum state preparation in a variational framework and
a specific use case for the SRBB hierarchy. The performance of the algorithm is
assessed with different loss functions, like fidelity, trace distance, and
Frobenius norm, in relation to two optimizers: Adam and Nelder-Mead. The
results highlight the potential of SRBB in close connection with the geometry
of unitary groups, achieving high accuracy up to 4 qubits in simulation, but
also its current limitations with an increasing number of qubits. Additionally,
the approximate SRBB-based QSP algorithm has been tested on real quantum
devices to assess its performance with a small number of qubits.

  Patterns",,,,,physics.soc-ph,http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/,"  The structure of heterogeneous networks and human mobility patterns
profoundly influence the spreading of endemic diseases. In small-scale
communities, individuals engage in social interactions within confined
environments, such as homes and workplaces, where daily routines facilitate
virus transmission through predictable mobility pathways. Here, we introduce a
metapopulation model grounded in a Microscopic Markov Chain Approach to
simulate susceptible--infected--susceptible dynamics within structured
populations. There are two primary types of nodes, homes and destinations,
where individuals interact and transmit infections through recurrent mobility
patterns. We derive analytical expressions for the epidemic threshold and
validate our theoretical findings through comparative simulations on
Watts--Strogatz and Barab\'asi--Albert networks. The experimental results
reveal a nonlinear relationship between mobility probability and the epidemic
threshold, indicating that further increases can inhibit disease transmission
beyond a certain critical mobility level.

  Everett",Active Learning For Repairable Hardware Systems With Partial Coverage,"Submitted to IEEE Reliability and Maintainability Symposium - Europe
  2025",,,,stat.AP cs.LG,http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/,"  Identifying the optimal diagnostic test and hardware system instance to infer
reliability characteristics using field data is challenging, especially when
constrained by fixed budgets and minimal maintenance cycles. Active Learning
(AL) has shown promise for parameter inference with limited data and budget
constraints in machine learning/deep learning tasks. However, AL for
reliability model parameter inference remains underexplored for repairable
hardware systems. It requires specialized AL Acquisition Functions (AFs) that
consider hardware aging and the fact that a hardware system consists of
multiple sub-systems, which may undergo only partial testing during a given
diagnostic test. To address these challenges, we propose a relaxed Mixed
Integer Semidefinite Program (MISDP) AL AF that incorporates Diagnostic
Coverage (DC), Fisher Information Matrices (FIMs), and diagnostic testing
budgets. Furthermore, we design empirical-based simulation experiments focusing
on two diagnostic testing scenarios: (1) partial tests of a hardware system
with overlapping subsystem coverage, and (2) partial tests where one diagnostic
test fully subsumes the subsystem coverage of another. We evaluate our proposed
approach against the most widely used AL AF in the literature (entropy), as
well as several intuitive AL AFs tailored for reliability model parameter
inference. Our proposed AF ranked best on average among the alternative AFs
across 6,000 experimental configurations, with respect to Area Under the Curve
(AUC) of the Absolute Total Expected Event Error (ATEER) and Mean Squared Error
(MSE) curves, with statistical significance calculated at a 0.05 alpha level
using a Friedman hypothesis test.
