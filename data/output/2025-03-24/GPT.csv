sampling a set of tools, formulating a requirement based on these tools, and
generating the call statements. However, tools sampled randomly lack relevance,
making them difficult to combine and thus reducing the diversity of the data.
Additionally, current work overlooks the coherence between turns of dialogues,
leading to a gap between the synthesized data and real-world scenarios. To
address these issues, we propose a Graph-based Sampling strategy to sample more
relevant tool combinations, and a Planned-generation strategy to create plans
that guide the synthesis of coherent dialogues. We integrate these two
strategies and enable multiple agents to synthesize the dialogue data
interactively, resulting in our tool-calling data synthesis pipeline ToolFlow.
Data quality assessments demonstrate improvements in the naturalness and

research has mainly focused on the mistakes in LLM-generated standalone

situations and identified a range of \textit{non-syntactic mistakes} arising
from LLMs' misunderstandings of coding question specifications. Seven
categories of non-syntactic mistakes were identified through extensive manual
analyses, four of which were missed by previous works. To better understand
these mistakes, we proposed six reasons behind these mistakes from various
perspectives. Moreover, we explored the effectiveness of LLMs in detecting
mistakes and their reasons. Our evaluation demonstrated that GPT-4 with the
ReAct prompting technique can achieve an F1 score of up to 0.65 when
identifying reasons for LLM's mistakes, such as misleading function signatures.
We believe that these findings offer valuable insights into enhancing the
quality of LLM-generated code.

Cancer-related queries are crucial for timely diagnosis, treatment, and patient

that support informed decision-making in cancer diagnosis and care, ultimately
improving patient outcomes. We calculate two metrics: A1 (which represents the

wherein a model must make a binary choice based on user features. Large-scale
domains such as legal codes or frequently updated funding opportunities render
human annotation (e.g., web forms or decision trees) impractical, highlighting
the need for agents that can automatically assist in decision-making. Since
relevant information is often only known to the user, it is crucial that these
agents ask the right questions. As agents determine when to terminate a
conversation, they face a trade-off between accuracy and the number of
questions asked, a key metric for both user experience and cost. To evaluate
this task, we propose BeNYfits, a new benchmark for determining user
eligibility for multiple overlapping social benefits opportunities through
interactive decision-making. Our experiments show that current language models
struggle with frequent hallucinations, with GPT-4o scoring only 35.7 F1 using a
ReAct-style chain-of-thought. To address this, we introduce ProADA, a novel
approach that leverages program synthesis to assist in decision-making by
mapping dialog planning to a code generation problem and using gaps in
structured data to determine the best next action. Our agent, ProADA, improves
the F1 score to 55.6 while maintaining nearly the same number of dialog turns.

presents SagaLLM, a structured multi-agent framework that addresses four
fundamental limitations in current LLM approaches: inadequate self-validation,
context narrowing, lacking transaction properties, and insufficient inter-agent
coordination. By implementing specialized context management agents and
validation protocols, SagaLLM preserves critical constraints and state

consistent decision-making even during disruptions. We evaluate our approach
using selected problems from the REALM benchmark, focusing on sequential and
reactive planning scenarios that challenge both context retention and adaptive
reasoning. Our experiments with state-of-the-art LLMs, Claude 3.7, DeepSeek R1,
GPT-4o, and GPT-o1, demonstrate that while these models exhibit impressive

across a variety of tasks, especially when equipped with carefully designed
visual prompts. However, existing studies primarily focus on logical reasoning
and visual understanding, while the capability of MLLMs to operate effectively
in 3D vision remains an ongoing area of exploration. In this paper, we
introduce a novel visual prompting method, called 3DAxisPrompt, to elicit the
3D understanding capabilities of MLLMs in real-world scenes. More specifically,
our method leverages the 3D coordinate axis and masks generated from the
Segment Anything Model (SAM) to provide explicit geometric priors to MLLMs and
then extend their impressive 2D grounding and reasoning ability to real-world
3D scenarios. Besides, we first provide a thorough investigation of the
potential visual prompting formats and conclude our findings to reveal the
potential and limits of 3D understanding capabilities in GPT-4o, as a
representative of MLLMs. Finally, we build evaluation environments with four
datasets, i.e., ScanRefer, ScanNet, FMB, and nuScene datasets, covering various
3D tasks. Based on this, we conduct extensive quantitative and qualitative
experiments, which demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method.
Overall, our study reveals that MLLMs, with the help of 3DAxisPrompt, can
effectively perceive an object's 3D position in real-world scenarios.
Nevertheless, a single prompt engineering approach does not consistently
achieve the best outcomes for all 3D tasks. This study highlights the
feasibility of leveraging MLLMs for 3D vision grounding/reasoning with prompt
engineering techniques.

tailored to each task. METASCALE initializes a pool of candidate meta-thoughts,
then iteratively selects and evaluates them using a multi-armed bandit
algorithm with upper confidence bound selection, guided by a reward model. To
further enhance adaptability, a genetic algorithm evolves high-reward
meta-thoughts, refining and extending the strategy pool over time. By
dynamically proposing and optimizing meta-thoughts at inference time, METASCALE
improves both accuracy and generalization across a wide range of tasks.
Experimental results demonstrate that MetaScale consistently outperforms
standard inference approaches, achieving an 11% performance gain in win rate on

designed to optimize Deep Learning (DL) training on single-node workstations
through an exceptionally efficient CPU-based backpropagation (Rumelhart et al.,
1986; Linnainmaa, 1970) implementation. Although modern DL frameworks rely on
compilerlike optimizations internally, BurTorch takes a different path. It
adopts a minimalist design and demonstrates that, in these circumstances,
classical compiled programming languages can play a significant role in DL
research. By eliminating the overhead of large frameworks and making efficient
implementation choices, BurTorch achieves orders-of-magnitude improvements in
performance and memory efficiency when computing $\nabla f(x)$ on a CPU.
BurTorch features a compact codebase designed to achieve two key goals
simultaneously. First, it provides a user experience similar to script-based
programming environments. Second, it dramatically minimizes runtime overheads.
In large DL frameworks, the primary source of memory overhead for relatively
small computation graphs $f(x)$ is due to feature-heavy implementations. We
benchmarked BurTorch against widely used DL frameworks in their execution
modes: JAX (Bradbury et al., 2018), PyTorch (Paszke et al., 2019), TensorFlow
(Abadi et al., 2016); and several standalone libraries: Autograd (Maclaurin et

small compute graphs, BurTorch outperforms best-practice solutions by up to
$\times 2000$ in runtime and reduces memory consumption by up to $\times 3500$.
For a miniaturized GPT-3 model (Brown et al., 2020), BurTorch achieves up to a

static features extracted from images sampled at a fixed low frame rate of

loss. In this paper, we introduce F-16, the first multimodal LLM designed for
high-frame-rate video understanding. By increasing the frame rate to 16 FPS and
compressing visual tokens within each 1-second clip, F-16 efficiently captures
dynamic visual features while preserving key semantic information. Experimental
results demonstrate that higher frame rates considerably enhance video
understanding across multiple benchmarks, providing a new approach to improving
video LLMs beyond scaling model size or training data. F-16 achieves
state-of-the-art performance among 7-billion-parameter video LLMs on both

follow explicit instructions but also on its capacity to navigate ambiguity,
incompleteness, invalidity, and irrelevance in communication. Gricean
conversational and inference norms facilitate collaboration by aligning unclear
instructions with cooperative principles. We propose a normative framework that
integrates Gricean norms and cognitive frameworks -- common ground, relevance
theory, and theory of mind -- into large language model (LLM) based agents. The
normative framework adopts the Gricean maxims of quantity, quality, relation,
and manner, along with inference, as Gricean norms to interpret unclear
instructions, which are: ambiguous, incomplete, invalid, or irrelevant. Within
this framework, we introduce Lamoids, GPT-4 powered agents designed to
collaborate with humans. To assess the influence of Gricean norms in human-AI
collaboration, we evaluate two versions of a Lamoid: one with norms and one
without. In our experiments, a Lamoid collaborates with a human to achieve
shared goals in a grid world (Doors, Keys, and Gems) by interpreting both clear
and unclear natural language instructions. Our results reveal that the Lamoid
with Gricean norms achieves higher task accuracy and generates clearer, more
accurate, and contextually relevant responses than the Lamoid without norms.
This improvement stems from the normative framework, which enhances the agent's
pragmatic reasoning, fostering effective human-AI collaboration and enabling
context-aware communication in LLM-based agents.

  Radiation Oncology","19 pages, 4 figures",,,,eess.IV cs.CV physics.med-ph,http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/,"  Background: Lung cancer ranks as the leading cause of cancer-related
mortality worldwide. The complexity of tumor delineation, crucial for radiation
therapy, requires expertise often unavailable in resource-limited settings.
Artificial Intelligence(AI), particularly with advancements in deep learning
(DL) and natural language processing (NLP), offers potential solutions yet is
challenged by high false positive rates. Purpose: The Oncology Contouring
Copilot (OCC) system is developed to leverage oncologist expertise for precise
tumor contouring using textual descriptions, aiming to increase the efficiency
of oncological workflows by combining the strengths of AI with human oversight.
Methods: Our OCC system initially identifies nodule candidates from CT scans.
Employing Language Vision Models (LVMs) like GPT-4V, OCC then effectively
reduces false positives with clinical descriptive texts, merging textual and
visual data to automate tumor delineation, designed to elevate the quality of
oncology care by incorporating knowledge from experienced domain experts.
Results: Deployments of the OCC system resulted in a significant reduction in
the false discovery rate by 35.0%, a 72.4% decrease in false positives per
scan, and an F1-score of 0.652 across our dataset for unbiased evaluation.
Conclusions: OCC represents a significant advance in oncology care,
particularly through the use of the latest LVMs to improve contouring results
by (1) streamlining oncology treatment workflows by optimizing tumor
delineation, reducing manual processes; (2) offering a scalable and intuitive
framework to reduce false positives in radiotherapy planning using LVMs; (3)
introducing novel medical language vision prompt techniques to minimize LVMs
hallucinations with ablation study, and (4) conducting a comparative analysis
of LVMs, highlighting their potential in addressing medical language vision
challenges.

diversities of fake media spread in the Internet, posing unprecedented threats
to social security, politics, law, and etc. To detect the ever-increasingly
diverse malicious fake media in the new era of AIGC, recent studies have
proposed to exploit Large Vision Language Models (LVLMs) to design robust
forgery detectors due to their impressive performance on a wide range of
multimodal tasks. However, it still lacks a comprehensive benchmark designed to
comprehensively assess LVLMs' discerning capabilities on forgery media. To fill
this gap, we present Forensics-Bench, a new forgery detection evaluation
benchmark suite to assess LVLMs across massive forgery detection tasks,
requiring comprehensive recognition, location and reasoning capabilities on
diverse forgeries. Forensics-Bench comprises 63,292 meticulously curated
multi-choice visual questions, covering 112 unique forgery detection types from
5 perspectives: forgery semantics, forgery modalities, forgery tasks, forgery
types and forgery models. We conduct thorough evaluations on 22 open-sourced
LVLMs and 3 proprietary models GPT-4o, Gemini 1.5 Pro, and Claude 3.5 Sonnet,
highlighting the significant challenges of comprehensive forgery detection
posed by Forensics-Bench. We anticipate that Forensics-Bench will motivate the
community to advance the frontier of LVLMs, striving for all-around forgery
detectors in the era of AIGC. The deliverables will be updated at

  Description and Polysemanticity Quantification",Accepted by CVPR2025,,,,cs.CV cs.AI,http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/,"  Explainability is a critical factor influencing the wide deployment of deep
vision models (DVMs). Concept-based post-hoc explanation methods can provide
both global and local insights into model decisions. However, current methods
in this field face challenges in that they are inflexible to automatically
construct accurate and sufficient linguistic explanations for global concepts
and local circuits. Particularly, the intrinsic polysemanticity in semantic
Visual Concepts (VCs) impedes the interpretability of concepts and DVMs, which
is underestimated severely. In this paper, we propose a Chain-of-Explanation
(CoE) approach to address these issues. Specifically, CoE automates the
decoding and description of VCs to construct global concept explanation
datasets. Further, to alleviate the effect of polysemanticity on model
explainability, we design a concept polysemanticity disentanglement and
filtering mechanism to distinguish the most contextually relevant concept
atoms. Besides, a Concept Polysemanticity Entropy (CPE), as a measure of model
interpretability, is formulated to quantify the degree of concept uncertainty.
The modeling of deterministic concepts is upgraded to uncertain concept atom
distributions. Finally, CoE automatically enables linguistic local explanations
of the decision-making process of DVMs by tracing the concept circuit. GPT-4o
and human-based experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of CPE and the
superiority of CoE, achieving an average absolute improvement of 36% in terms
of explainability scores.

significant challenges in identifying and understanding manipulated visual
content. Current fake image detection methods predominantly rely on binary
classification models that focus on accuracy while often neglecting
interpretability, leaving users without clear insights into why an image is
deemed real or fake. To bridge this gap, we introduce TruthLens, a novel
training-free framework that reimagines deepfake detection as a visual
question-answering (VQA) task. TruthLens utilizes state-of-the-art large
vision-language models (LVLMs) to observe and describe visual artifacts and
combines this with the reasoning capabilities of large language models (LLMs)
like GPT-4 to analyze and aggregate evidence into informed decisions. By
adopting a multimodal approach, TruthLens seamlessly integrates visual and
semantic reasoning to not only classify images as real or fake but also provide
interpretable explanations for its decisions. This transparency enhances trust
and provides valuable insights into the artifacts that signal synthetic
content. Extensive evaluations demonstrate that TruthLens outperforms
conventional methods, achieving high accuracy on challenging datasets while
maintaining a strong emphasis on explainability. By reframing deepfake
detection as a reasoning-driven process, TruthLens establishes a new paradigm
in combating synthetic media, combining cutting-edge performance with
interpretability to address the growing threats of visual disinformation.

Building on this benchmark, we propose a novel RL algorithm, SWEET-RL (RL with
Step-WisE Evaluation from Training-time information), that uses a carefully
designed optimization objective to train a critic model with access to
additional training-time information. The critic provides step-level rewards
for improving the policy model. Our experiments demonstrate that SWEET-RL

in-context learning (ICL) capability of Transformer architecture to learn on
the fly from limited examples. While ICL underpins many LLM applications, its
full potential remains hindered by a limited understanding of its
generalization boundaries and vulnerabilities. We present a systematic
investigation of transformers' generalization capability with ICL relative to
training data coverage by defining a task-centric framework along three
dimensions: inter-problem, intra-problem, and intra-task generalization.
Through extensive simulation and real-world experiments, encompassing tasks
such as function fitting, API calling, and translation, we find that
transformers lack inter-problem generalization with ICL, but excel in
intra-task and intra-problem generalization. When the training data includes a
greater variety of mixed tasks, it significantly enhances the generalization
ability of ICL on unseen tasks and even on known simple tasks. This guides us
in designing training data to maximize the diversity of tasks covered and to
combine different tasks whenever possible, rather than solely focusing on the
target task for testing.

improving their actions. While numerical reward signals and verifiers can
effectively rank candidate actions, they often provide limited contextual
guidance. In contrast, natural language feedback better aligns with the

language feedback. By training the critic to produce fine-grained assessments
and actionable revisions, and the actor to utilize these critiques, our
approach promotes more robust exploration of alternative strategies while
avoiding local optima. Experiments in three interactive environments show that
CGI outperforms existing baselines by a substantial margin. Notably, even a

variety of use cases such as simulating agents, searching for information, or
for content analysis. For all of these applications and others, political
biases in these models can affect their performance. Several researchers have
attempted to study political bias in language models using evaluation suites
based on surveys, such as the Political Compass Test (PCT), often finding a
particular leaning favored by these models. However, there is some variation in
the exact prompting techniques, leading to diverging findings and most research
relies on constrained-answer settings to extract model responses. Moreover, the
Political Compass Test is not a scientifically valid survey instrument. In this
work, we contribute a political bias measured informed by political science
theory, building on survey design principles to test a wide variety of input
prompts, while taking into account prompt sensitivity. We then prompt 11
different open and commercial models, differentiating between instruction-tuned
and non-instruction-tuned models, and automatically classify their political
stances from 88,110 responses. Leveraging this dataset, we compute political
bias profiles across different prompt variations and find that while PCT
exaggerates bias in certain models like GPT3.5, measures of political bias are
often unstable, but generally more left-leaning for instruction-tuned models.
