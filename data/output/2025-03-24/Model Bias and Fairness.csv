societal sectors, understanding and establishing causality becomes essential
for evaluating the fairness of automated systems. This article explores the
significance of causal reasoning in addressing algorithmic discrimination,
emphasizing both legal and societal perspectives. By reviewing landmark cases
and regulatory frameworks, particularly within the European Union, we
illustrate the challenges inherent in proving causal claims when confronted
with opaque AI decision-making processes. The discussion outlines practical
obstacles and methodological limitations in applying causal inference to
real-world fairness scenarios, proposing actionable solutions to enhance
transparency, accountability, and fairness in algorithm-driven decisions.

this work, in what is absent from data. In healthcare, societal and decision
biases shape patterns in missing data, yet the algorithmic fairness
implications of group-specific missingness are poorly understood. The way we
address missingness in healthcare can have detrimental impacts on downstream
algorithmic fairness. Our work questions current recommendations and practices
aimed at handling missing data with a focus on their effect on algorithmic
fairness, and offers a path forward. Specifically, we consider the theoretical
underpinnings of existing recommendations as well as their empirical predictive
performance and corresponding algorithmic fairness measured through subgroup
performances. Our results show that current practices for handling missingness
lack principled foundations, are disconnected from the realities of missingness
mechanisms in healthcare, and can be counterproductive. For example, we show
that favouring group-specific imputation strategy can be misguided and
exacerbate prediction disparities. We then build on our findings to propose a
framework for empirically guiding imputation choices, and an accompanying
reporting framework. Our work constitutes an important contribution to recent
efforts by regulators and practitioners to grapple with the realities of
real-world data, and to foster the responsible and transparent deployment of
machine learning systems. We demonstrate the practical utility of the proposed
framework through experimentation on widely used datasets, where we show how
the proposed framework can guide the selection of imputation strategies,
allowing us to choose among strategies that yield equal overall predictive
performance but present different algorithmic fairness properties.

can have unwanted consequences, in particular, when optimizing the policy under
such constraints. Here, we advocate to instead focus on the utility function
the policy is optimizing for. We define value of information fairness and
propose to not use utility functions that violate this criterion. This
principle suggests to modify these utility functions such that they satisfy
value of information fairness. We describe how this can be done and discuss
consequences for the corresponding optimal policies. We apply our framework to
thought experiments and the COMPAS data. Focussing on the utility function
provides better answers than existing fairness notions: We are not aware of any
intuitively fair policy that is disallowed by value of information fairness,
and when we find that value of information fairness recommends an intuitively
unfair policy, no existing fairness notion finds an intuitively fair policy.

satellite constellations into 5G and Beyond is essential to achieve truly
global connectivity. A distinctive characteristic of LEO mega constellations is
that they constitute a global infrastructure with predictable dynamics, which
enables the pre-planned allocation of radio resources. However, the different
bands that can be used for ground-to-satellite communication are affected
differently by atmospheric conditions such as precipitation, which introduces
uncertainty on the attenuation of the communication links at high frequencies.
Based on this, we present a compelling case for applying integrated sensing and
communications (ISAC) in heterogeneous and multi-layer LEO satellite
constellations over wide areas. Specifically, we propose a sensing-assisted
communications framework and frame structure that not only enables the accurate
estimation of the atmospheric attenuation in the communication links through
sensing but also leverages this information to determine the optimal serving
satellites and allocate resources efficiently for downlink communication with
users on the ground. The results show that, by dedicating an adequate amount of
resources for sensing and solving the association and resource allocation
problems jointly, it is feasible to increase the average throughput by 59% and
the fairness by 700% when compared to solving these problems separately.

  Value Imputation",,,,,cs.AI cs.CY cs.LG,http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-nd/4.0/,"  Data missingness is a practical challenge of sustained interest to the
scientific community. In this paper, we present Shades-of-Null, an evaluation
suite for responsible missing value imputation. Our work is novel in two ways
(i) we model realistic and socially-salient missingness scenarios that go
beyond Rubin's classic Missing Completely at Random (MCAR), Missing At Random
(MAR) and Missing Not At Random (MNAR) settings, to include multi-mechanism
missingness (when different missingness patterns co-exist in the data) and
missingness shift (when the missingness mechanism changes between training and
test) (ii) we evaluate imputers holistically, based on imputation quality and
imputation fairness, as well as on the predictive performance, fairness and
stability of the models that are trained and tested on the data
post-imputation.
  We use Shades-of-Null to conduct a large-scale empirical study involving
29,736 experimental pipelines, and find that while there is no single
best-performing imputation approach for all missingness types, interesting
trade-offs arise between predictive performance, fairness and stability, based
on the combination of missingness scenario, imputer choice, and the
architecture of the predictive model. We make Shades-of-Null publicly
available, to enable researchers to rigorously evaluate missing value
imputation methods on a wide range of metrics in plausible and socially
meaningful scenarios.

Unlike traditional unimodal methods, which analyze each modality separately
without considering the interaction between them, often leading to incomplete

interact and contribute to predictions, providing a holistic view of the
model's decision-making. Additionally, we enhance local explanations by
aggregating them into global explanations, giving users a broader perspective
of model behavior. Through this work, we contribute to improving the
interpretability of multimodal music models, empowering users to make informed

understanding of how model design choices and data distribution properties
contribute to bias is needed. In this work, we contribute a precise analytical
theory in the context of ridge regression, both with and without random
projections, where the former models feedforward neural networks in a
simplified regime. Our theory offers a unified and rigorous explanation of
machine learning bias, providing insights into phenomena such as bias
amplification and minority-group bias in various feature and parameter regimes.
For example, we observe that there may be an optimal regularization penalty or
training time to avoid bias amplification, and there can be differences in test
error between groups that are not alleviated with increased parameterization.
Importantly, our theoretical predictions align with empirical observations
reported in the literature on machine learning bias. We extensively empirically

deployment phases are necessary because these models possess numerous
capabilities (e.g., mathematical reasoning, legal support, or medical
diagnostic) as well as safety risks (e.g., racial bias, toxicity, or
misinformation). The average score across a wide range of benchmarks provides a
signal that helps guide the use of these LMs in practice. Currently, holistic
evaluations are costly due to the large volume of benchmark questions, making
frequent evaluations impractical. A popular attempt to lower the cost is to
compute the average score on a subset of the benchmark. This approach,
unfortunately, often renders an unreliable measure of LM performance because
the average score is often confounded with the difficulty of the questions in
the benchmark subset. Item response theory (IRT) was designed to address this
challenge, providing a reliable measurement by careful controlling for question
difficulty. Unfortunately, question difficulty is expensive to estimate. Facing
this challenge, we train a model that predicts question difficulty from its
content, enabling a reliable measurement at a fraction of the cost. In
addition, we leverage this difficulty predictor to further improve the
evaluation efficiency through training a question generator given a difficulty
level. This question generator is essential in adaptive testing, where, instead
of using a random subset of the benchmark questions, informative questions are
adaptively chosen based on the current estimation of LLM performance.
Experiments on 22 common natural language benchmarks and 172 LMs show that this

  Catolino, Gregorio Robles, Fabio Palomba","Contextual Fairness-Aware Practices in ML: A Cost-Effective Empirical
  Evaluation",,,,,cs.SE,http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/,"  As machine learning (ML) systems become central to critical decision-making,
concerns over fairness and potential biases have increased. To address this,
the software engineering (SE) field has introduced bias mitigation techniques
aimed at enhancing fairness in ML models at various stages. Additionally,
recent research suggests that standard ML engineering practices can also
improve fairness; these practices, known as fairness-aware practices, have been
cataloged across each stage of the ML development life cycle. However, fairness
remains context-dependent, with different domains requiring customized
solutions. Furthermore, existing specific bias mitigation methods may sometimes
degrade model performance, raising ongoing discussions about the trade-offs
involved.
  In this paper, we empirically investigate fairness-aware practices from two
perspectives: contextual and cost-effectiveness. The contextual evaluation
explores how these practices perform in various application domains,
identifying areas where specific fairness adjustments are particularly
effective. The cost-effectiveness evaluation considers the trade-off between
fairness improvements and potential performance costs. Our findings provide
insights into how context influences the effectiveness of fairness-aware
practices. This research aims to guide SE practitioners in selecting practices
that achieve fairness with minimal performance costs, supporting the
development of ethical ML systems.

  Segmentation with Causal Intervention",MICCAI 2024,,,,cs.CV,http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/,"  Referring medical image segmentation targets delineating lesions indicated by
textual descriptions. Aligning visual and textual cues is challenging due to
their distinct data properties. Inspired by large-scale pre-trained
vision-language models, we propose CausalCLIPSeg, an end-to-end framework for
referring medical image segmentation that leverages CLIP. Despite not being
trained on medical data, we enforce CLIP's rich semantic space onto the medical
domain by a tailored cross-modal decoding method to achieve text-to-pixel
alignment. Furthermore, to mitigate confounding bias that may cause the model
to learn spurious correlations instead of meaningful causal relationships,
CausalCLIPSeg introduces a causal intervention module which self-annotates
confounders and excavates causal features from inputs for segmentation
judgments. We also devise an adversarial min-max game to optimize causal
features while penalizing confounding ones. Extensive experiments demonstrate
the state-of-the-art performance of our proposed method. Code is available at
https://github.com/WUTCM-Lab/CausalCLIPSeg.

on generating rewritten utterances based solely on dialogue context, ignoring
the widespread phenomenon of coreference and ellipsis in dialogues. To address
this issue, we propose a novel framework called TEO (\emph{Two-stage approach
on Editing Operation}) for IUR, in which the first stage generates editing
operations and the second stage rewrites incomplete utterances utilizing the
generated editing operations and the dialogue context. Furthermore, an
adversarial perturbation strategy is proposed to mitigate cascading errors and
exposure bias caused by the inconsistency between training and inference in the
second stage. Experimental results on three IUR datasets show that our TEO
outperforms the SOTA models significantly.

  publication",,,,cs.NI,http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/,"  In large-scale UAV swarms, dynamically executing machine learning tasks can
pose significant challenges due to network volatility and the heterogeneous
resource constraints of each UAV. Traditional approaches often rely on
centralized orchestration to partition tasks among nodes. However, these
methods struggle with communication bottlenecks, latency, and reliability when
the swarm grows or the topology shifts rapidly. To overcome these limitations,
we propose a fully distributed, diffusive metric-based approach for split
computing in UAV swarms. Our solution introduces a new iterative measure,
termed the aggregated gigaflops, capturing each node's own computing capacity
along with that of its neighbors without requiring global network knowledge. By
forwarding partial inferences intelligently to underutilized nodes, we achieve
improved task throughput, lower latency, and enhanced energy efficiency.
Further, to handle sudden workload surges and rapidly changing node conditions,
we incorporate an early-exit mechanism that can adapt the inference pathway
on-the-fly. Extensive simulations demonstrate that our approach significantly
outperforms baseline strategies across multiple performance indices, including
latency, fairness, and energy consumption. These results highlight the
feasibility of large-scale distributed intelligence in UAV swarms and provide a
blueprint for deploying robust, scalable ML services in diverse aerial
networks.

  by Balancing Privacy, Fairness and Utility in Autonomous Vehicles",Submitted to PETS 2025 (under review),,,,cs.LG cs.CV cs.DC cs.ET,http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/,"  Autonomous vehicles (AVs) increasingly rely on Federated Learning (FL) to
enhance perception models while preserving privacy. However, existing FL
frameworks struggle to balance privacy, fairness, and robustness, leading to
performance disparities across demographic groups. Privacy-preserving
techniques like differential privacy mitigate data leakage risks but worsen
fairness by restricting access to sensitive attributes needed for bias
correction. This work explores the trade-off between privacy and fairness in
FL-based object detection for AVs and introduces RESFL, an integrated solution
optimizing both. RESFL incorporates adversarial privacy disentanglement and
uncertainty-guided fairness-aware aggregation. The adversarial component uses a
gradient reversal layer to remove sensitive attributes, reducing privacy risks
while maintaining fairness. The uncertainty-aware aggregation employs an
evidential neural network to weight client updates adaptively, prioritizing
contributions with lower fairness disparities and higher confidence. This
ensures robust and equitable FL model updates. We evaluate RESFL on the FACET
dataset and CARLA simulator, assessing accuracy, fairness, privacy resilience,
and robustness under varying conditions. RESFL improves detection accuracy,
reduces fairness disparities, and lowers privacy attack success rates while
demonstrating superior robustness to adversarial conditions compared to other
approaches.

  Caps",32 pages,,,,cs.GT,http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/,"  Lindahl equilibrium is a solution concept for allocating a fixed budget
across several divisible public goods. It always lies in the core, meaning that
the equilibrium allocation satisfies desirable stability and proportional
fairness properties. We consider a model where agents have separable linear
utility functions over the public goods, and the output assigns to each good an
amount of spending, summing to at most the available budget.
  In the uncapped setting, each of the public goods can absorb any amount of
funding. In this case, it is known that Lindahl equilibrium is equivalent to
maximizing Nash social welfare, and this allocation can be computed by a
public-goods variant of the proportional response dynamics. We introduce a new
convex programming formulation for computing this solution and show that it is
related to Nash welfare maximization through duality and reformulation. We then
show that the proportional response dynamics is equivalent to running mirror
descent on our new formulation, thereby providing a new and immediate proof of
the convergence guarantee for the dynamics. Our new formulation has
similarities to Shmyrev's convex program for Fisher market equilibrium.
  In the capped setting, each public good has an upper bound on the amount of
funding it can receive. In this setting, existence of Lindahl equilibrium was
only known via fixed-point arguments. The existence of an efficient algorithm
computing one has been a long-standing open question. We prove that our new
convex program continues to work when the cap constraints are added, and its
optimal solutions are Lindahl equilibria. Thus, we establish that Lindahl
equilibrium can be efficiently computed in the capped setting. Our result also
implies that approximately core-stable allocations can be efficiently computed
for the class of separable piecewise-linear concave (SPLC) utilities.
