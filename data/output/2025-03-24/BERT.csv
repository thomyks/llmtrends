2312.10048,Kavita Sharma,"Kavita Sharma, Ritu Patel, Sunita Iyer",Knowledge Graph Enhanced Aspect-Level Sentiment Analysis,,,,,cs.CL,http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/,"  In this paper, we propose a novel method to enhance sentiment analysis by
addressing the challenge of context-specific word meanings. It combines the
advantages of a BERT model with a knowledge graph based synonym data. This
synergy leverages a dynamic attention mechanism to develop a knowledge-driven
state vector. For classifying sentiments linked to specific aspects, the
approach constructs a memory bank integrating positional data. The data are
then analyzed using a DCGRU to pinpoint sentiment characteristics related to
specific aspect terms. Experiments on three widely used datasets demonstrate
the superior performance of our method in sentiment classification.

  Data",,,,,cs.AI,http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/,"  In this paper, we propose a method to automatically classify AI-related
documents from large-scale literature databases, leading to the creation of an
AI-related literature dataset, named DeepDiveAI. The dataset construction
approach integrates expert knowledge with the capabilities of advanced models,
structured across two global stages. In the first stage, expert-curated
classification datasets are used to train an LSTM model, which classifies
coarse AI related records from large-scale datasets. In the second stage, we
use Qwen2.5 Plus to annotate a random 10% of the coarse AI-related records,
which are then used to train a BERT binary classifier. This step further
refines the coarse AI related record set to obtain the final DeepDiveAI
dataset. Evaluation results demonstrate that the entire workflow can
efficiently and accurately identify AI-related literature from large-scale
datasets.

  Vision Transformers","This work has been accepted for the IEEE Robotics and Automation
  Letters (RA-L)",,,,eess.AS cs.HC cs.RO cs.SD,http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/,"  Emotions are an essential element in verbal communication, so understanding
individuals' affect during a human-robot interaction (HRI) becomes imperative.
This paper investigates the application of vision transformer models, namely
ViT (Vision Transformers) and BEiT (BERT Pre-Training of Image Transformers)
pipelines, for Speech Emotion Recognition (SER) in HRI. The focus is to
generalize the SER models for individual speech characteristics by fine-tuning
these models on benchmark datasets and exploiting ensemble methods. For this
purpose, we collected audio data from different human subjects having
pseudo-naturalistic conversations with the NAO robot. We then fine-tuned our
ViT and BEiT-based models and tested these models on unseen speech samples from
the participants. In the results, we show that fine-tuning vision transformers
on benchmark datasets and and then using either these already fine-tuned models
or ensembling ViT/BEiT models gets us the highest classification accuracies per
individual when it comes to identifying four primary emotions from their
speech: neutral, happy, sad, and angry, as compared to fine-tuning vanilla-ViTs
or BEiTs.

quantify textual information to predict stock performance. Using an extensive
dataset of Chinese analyst reports and employing a customized BERT deep
learning model for Chinese text, this study categorizes the sentiment of the
reports as positive, neutral, or negative. The findings underscore the
predictive capacity of this sentiment indicator for stock volatility, excess
returns, and trading volume. Specifically, analyst reports with strong positive
sentiment will increase excess return and intraday volatility, and vice versa,
reports with strong negative sentiment also increase volatility and trading
volume, but decrease future excess return. The magnitude of this effect is
greater for positive sentiment reports than for negative sentiment reports.
This article contributes to the empirical literature on sentiment analysis and
the response of the stock market to news in the Chinese stock market.

2502.21206,Songrun He,"Songrun He, Linying Lv, Asaf Manela, Jimmy Wu",Chronologically Consistent Large Language Models,,,,,q-fin.GN q-fin.TR,http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/,"  Large language models are increasingly used in social sciences, but their
training data can introduce lookahead bias and training leakage. A good
chronologically consistent language model requires efficient use of training
data to maintain accuracy despite time-restricted data. Here, we overcome this
challenge by training a suite of chronologically consistent large language
models, ChronoBERT and ChronoGPT, which incorporate only the text data that
would have been available at each point in time. Despite this strict temporal
constraint, our models achieve strong performance on natural language
processing benchmarks, outperforming or matching widely used models (e.g.,
BERT), and remain competitive with larger open-weight models. Lookahead bias is
model and application-specific because even if a chronologically consistent
language model has poorer language comprehension, a regression or prediction
model applied on top of the language model can compensate. In an asset pricing
application predicting next-day stock returns from financial news, we find that
ChronoBERT's real-time outputs achieve a Sharpe ratio comparable to
state-of-the-art models, indicating that lookahead bias is modest. Our results
demonstrate a scalable, practical framework to mitigate training leakage,
ensuring more credible backtests and predictions across finance and other
social science domains.

  using LLMs",,,,,cs.CL,http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/,"  Early detection of depression from social media data offers a valuable
opportunity for timely intervention. However, this task poses significant
challenges, requiring both professional medical knowledge and the development
of accurate and explainable models. In this paper, we propose LLM-MTD (Large
Language Model for Multi-Task Depression Detection), a novel approach that
leverages a pre-trained large language model to simultaneously classify social
media posts for depression and generate textual explanations grounded in
medical diagnostic criteria. We train our model using a multi-task learning
framework with a combined loss function that optimizes both classification
accuracy and explanation quality. We evaluate LLM-MTD on the benchmark Reddit
Self-Reported Depression Dataset (RSDD) and compare its performance against
several competitive baseline methods, including traditional machine learning
and fine-tuned BERT. Our experimental results demonstrate that LLM-MTD achieves
state-of-the-art performance in depression detection, showing significant
improvements in AUPRC and other key metrics. Furthermore, human evaluation of
the generated explanations reveals their relevance, completeness, and medical
accuracy, highlighting the enhanced interpretability of our approach. This work
contributes a novel methodology for depression detection that combines the
power of large language models with the crucial aspect of explainability.

2503.14928,Jiaxin Ye,Jiaxin Ye and Hongming Shan,Shushing! Let's Imagine an Authentic Speech from the Silent Video,Project Page: https://imagintalk.github.io,,,,cs.CV cs.AI cs.SD eess.AS,http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/,"  Vision-guided speech generation aims to produce authentic speech from facial
appearance or lip motions without relying on auditory signals, offering
significant potential for applications such as dubbing in filmmaking and
assisting individuals with aphonia. Despite recent progress, existing methods
struggle to achieve unified cross-modal alignment across semantics, timbre, and
emotional prosody from visual cues, prompting us to propose Consistent
Video-to-Speech (CV2S) as an extended task to enhance cross-modal consistency.
To tackle emerging challenges, we introduce ImaginTalk, a novel cross-modal
diffusion framework that generates faithful speech using only visual input,
operating within a discrete space. Specifically, we propose a discrete lip
aligner that predicts discrete speech tokens from lip videos to capture
semantic information, while an error detector identifies misaligned tokens,
which are subsequently refined through masked language modeling with BERT. To
further enhance the expressiveness of the generated speech, we develop a style
diffusion transformer equipped with a face-style adapter that adaptively
customizes identity and prosody dynamics across both the channel and temporal
dimensions while ensuring synchronization with lip-aware semantic features.
Extensive experiments demonstrate that ImaginTalk can generate high-fidelity
speech with more accurate semantic details and greater expressiveness in timbre
and emotion compared to state-of-the-art baselines. Demos are shown at our
project page: https://imagintalk.github.io.

the identification of concrete terms related to a sentiment, the equivalent
field of Aspect-based Emotion Analysis (ABEA) is faced with dataset bottlenecks
and the increased complexity of emotion classes in contrast to binary
sentiments. This paper addresses these gaps, by generating a first ABEA
training dataset, consisting of 2,621 English Tweets, and fine-tuning a
BERT-based model for the ABEA sub-tasks of Aspect Term Extraction (ATE) and
Aspect Emotion Classification (AEC).
  The dataset annotation process was based on the hierarchical emotion theory
by Shaver et al. [1] and made use of group annotation and majority voting
strategies to facilitate label consistency. The resulting dataset contained
aspect-level emotion labels for Anger, Sadness, Happiness, Fear, and a None
class. Using the new ABEA training dataset, the state-of-the-art ABSA model
GRACE by Luo et al. [2] was fine-tuned for ABEA. The results reflected a
performance plateau at an F1-score of 70.1% for ATE and 46.9% for joint ATE and
AEC extraction. The limiting factors for model performance were broadly
identified as the small training dataset size coupled with the increased task
complexity, causing model overfitting and limited abilities to generalize well
on new data.
