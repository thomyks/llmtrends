  Detecting T2 Hyperintensity in MRI Spinal Cord",,,,,eess.IV cs.CV,http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-nd/4.0/,"  T2 hyperintensities in spinal cord MR images are crucial biomarkers for
conditions such as degenerative cervical myelopathy. However, current clinical
diagnoses primarily rely on manual evaluation. Deep learning methods have shown
promise in lesion detection, but most supervised approaches are heavily
dependent on large, annotated datasets. Unsupervised anomaly detection (UAD)
offers a compelling alternative by eliminating the need for abnormal data
annotations. However, existing UAD methods rely on curated normal datasets and
their performance frequently deteriorates when applied to clinical datasets due
to domain shifts. We propose an Uncertainty-based Unsupervised Anomaly
Detection framework, termed U2AD, to address these limitations. Unlike
traditional methods, U2AD is designed to be trained and tested within the same
clinical dataset, following a ""mask-and-reconstruction"" paradigm built on a
Vision Transformer-based architecture. We introduce an uncertainty-guided
masking strategy to resolve task conflicts between normal reconstruction and
anomaly detection to achieve an optimal balance. Specifically, we employ a
Monte-Carlo sampling technique to estimate reconstruction uncertainty mappings
during training. By iteratively optimizing reconstruction training under the
guidance of both epistemic and aleatoric uncertainty, U2AD reduces overall
reconstruction variance while emphasizing regions. Experimental results
demonstrate that U2AD outperforms existing supervised and unsupervised methods
in patient-level identification and segment-level localization tasks. This
framework establishes a new benchmark for incorporating uncertainty guidance
into UAD, highlighting its clinical utility in addressing domain shifts and
task conflicts in medical image anomaly detection. Our code is available:
