  Guidance",,,,,cs.CV,http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/,"  Existing neural implicit surface reconstruction methods have achieved
impressive performance in multi-view 3D reconstruction by leveraging explicit
geometry priors such as depth maps or point clouds as regularization. However,
the reconstruction results still lack fine details because of the over-smoothed
depth map or sparse point cloud. In this work, we propose a neural implicit
surface reconstruction pipeline with guidance from 3D Gaussian Splatting to
recover highly detailed surfaces. The advantage of 3D Gaussian Splatting is
that it can generate dense point clouds with detailed structure. Nonetheless, a
naive adoption of 3D Gaussian Splatting can fail since the generated points are
the centers of 3D Gaussians that do not necessarily lie on the surface. We thus
introduce a scale regularizer to pull the centers close to the surface by
enforcing the 3D Gaussians to be extremely thin. Moreover, we propose to refine
the point cloud from 3D Gaussians Splatting with the normal priors from the
surface predicted by neural implicit models instead of using a fixed set of
points as guidance. Consequently, the quality of surface reconstruction
improves from the guidance of the more accurate 3D Gaussian splatting. By
jointly optimizing the 3D Gaussian Splatting and the neural implicit model, our
approach benefits from both representations and generates complete surfaces
with intricate details. Experiments on Tanks and Temples verify the
effectiveness of our proposed method.

  Learning Framework for Time Series Anomaly Detection",This paper has been accepted by SIGMOD 2025,,,,cs.LG cs.AI cs.DB,http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/,"  Model selection has been raised as an essential problem in the area of time
series anomaly detection (TSAD), because there is no single best TSAD model for
the highly heterogeneous time series in real-world applications. However,
despite the success of existing model selection solutions that train a
classification model (especially neural network, NN) using historical data as a
selector to predict the correct TSAD model for each series, the NN-based
selector learning methods used by existing solutions do not make full use of
the knowledge in the historical data and require iterating over all training
samples, which limits the accuracy and training speed of the selector. To
address these limitations, we propose KDSelector, a novel knowledge-enhanced
and data-efficient framework for learning the NN-based TSAD model selector, of
which three key components are specifically designed to integrate available
knowledge into the selector and dynamically prune less important and redundant
samples during the learning. We develop a TSAD model selection system with
KDSelector as the internal, to demonstrate how users improve the accuracy and
training speed of their selectors by using KDSelector as a plug-and-play
module. Our demonstration video is hosted at https://youtu.be/2uqupDWvTF0.

  parabolic equations","21 pages, 16 figures",,,,math.NA cs.NA,http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/,"  In this paper, we present a novel enhancement to the conventional
$hr$-adaptive finite element methods for parabolic equations, integrating
traditional $h$-adaptive and $r$-adaptive methods via neural networks. A major
challenge in $hr$-adaptive finite element methods lies in projecting the
previous step's finite element solution onto the updated mesh. This projection
depends on the new mesh and must be recomputed for each adaptive iteration. To
address this, we introduce a neural network to construct a mesh-free surrogate
of the previous step finite element solution. Since the neural network is
mesh-free, it only requires training once per time step, with its parameters
initialized using the optimizer from the previous time step. This approach
effectively overcomes the interpolation challenges associated with non-nested
meshes in computation, making node insertion and movement more convenient and
efficient. The new algorithm also emphasizes SIZING and GENERATE, allowing each
refinement to roughly double the number of mesh nodes of the previous iteration
and then redistribute them to form a new mesh that effectively captures the
singularities. It significantly reduces the time required for repeated
refinement and achieves the desired accuracy in no more than seven
space-adaptive iterations per time step. Numerical experiments confirm the
efficiency of the proposed algorithm in capturing dynamic changes of
singularities.

  Shi",Populating Large N-body Simulations with LRGs Using Neural Networks,"20 pages, 20 figures",,,,astro-ph.CO,http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/,"  The analysis of state-of-the-art cosmological surveys like the Dark Energy
Spectroscopic Instrument (DESI) survey requires high-resolution, large-volume
simulations. However, the computational cost of hydrodynamical simulations at
these scales is prohibitive. Instead, dark matter (DM)-only simulations are
used, with galaxies populated a posteriori, typically via halo occupation
distribution (HOD) models. While effective, HOD models are statistical in
nature and lack full physical motivation.
  In this work, we explore using neural networks (NNs) to learn the complex,
physically motivated relationships between DM haloes and galaxy properties.
Trained on small-volume, high-resolution hydrodynamical simulations, our NN
predicts galaxy properties in a larger DM-only simulation and determines which
galaxies should be classified as luminous red galaxies (LRGs).
  Comparing the original LRG sample to the one generated by our NN, we find
that, while the subhalo mass distributions are similar, our NN selects fewer
low-mass subhaloes as LRG hosts, possibly due to the absence of baryonic
feedback effects in DM-only simulations. This feedback could brighten or redden
galaxies, altering their classification.
  Finally, we generate a new LRG sample by fitting an HOD model to the
NN-generated LRG sample. We verify that both the HOD- and NN-generated samples
preserve a set of bias parameter relations, which assume that the higher-order
parameters, $b_{s2}$ and $b_{3\rm{nl}}$, are determined by the linear bias
parameter $b_{1}$. These relations are commonly used to simplify clustering
analyses.

  Constraint",,,,,math.OC,http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/,"  An optimal guidance law for impact time control with field-of-view constraint
is presented. The guidance law is derived by first converting the
inequality-constrained nonlinear optimal control problem into an
equality-constrained one through a saturation function. Based on Pontryagin's
maximum principle, a parameterized system satisfying the necessary optimality
conditions is established. By propagating this system, a large number of
extremal trajectories can be efficiently generated. These trajectories are then
used to train a neural network that maps the current state and time-to-go to
the optimal guidance command. The trained neural network can generate optimal
commands within 0.1 milliseconds while satisfying the field-of-view constraint.
Numerical simulations demonstrate that the proposed guidance law outperforms
existing methods and achieves nearly optimal performance in terms of control
effort.

  Stokesian Dynamics",,,,,physics.flu-dyn cond-mat.soft,http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/,"  Stokesian Dynamics (SD) is a numerical framework used for simulating
hydrodynamic interactions in particle suspensions at low Reynolds number. It
combines far-field approximations with near-field lubrication corrections,
offering a balance between accuracy and efficiency. This work reviews SD and
provides a perspective on future directions for this approach. We outline the
mathematical foundations, the method's strengths and weaknesses, and the
computational challenges that need to be overcome to work with SD effectively.
We also discuss recent advancements that improve the algorithm's efficiency,
including the use of iterative solvers and matrix-free approaches. In addition,
we highlight the limitations of making stronger, albeit more cost-effective
approximations to studying hydrodynamic interactions in dense suspensions than
made in SD, such as the two-body Rotne-Prager-Yamakawa (RPY) approximation. To
overcome these issues, we propose a hybrid framework that replaces SD's full
many-body computations with a neural network trained on SD data. That is, we
correct the RPY approximation, while avoiding costly matrix inversions. We
demonstrate the potential of this method on a simple system, where we find a
close match to SD data while algorithmically outperforming RPY. Our work
provides an outlook on the way in which large-scale simulations of particle
suspensions can be performed in the foreseeable future.

causal mechanism between the involved variables. Structural causal models
(SCMs) are widely used to represent such causal mechanisms. Given an SCM,
causal queries on all three levels of Pearl's causal hierarchy can be answered:
$L_1$ observational, $L_2$ interventional, and $L_3$ counterfactual. An
essential aspect of modeling the SCM is to model the dependency of each
variable on its causal parents. Traditionally this is done by parametric
statistical models, such as linear or logistic regression models. This allows
to handle all kinds of data types and fit interpretable models but bears the
risk of introducing a bias. More recently neural causal models came up using
neural networks (NNs) to model the causal relationships, allowing the
estimation of nearly any underlying functional form without bias. However,
current neural causal models are generally restricted to continuous variables
and do not yield an interpretable form of the causal relationships.
Transformation models range from simple statistical regressions to complex
networks and can handle continuous, ordinal, and binary data. Here, we propose
to use TRAMs to model the functional relationships in SCMs allowing us to
bridge the gap between interpretability and flexibility in causal modeling. We
call this method TRAM-DAG and assume currently that the underlying directed
acyclic graph is known. For the fully observed case, we benchmark TRAM-DAGs
against state-of-the-art statistical and NN-based causal models. We show that
TRAM-DAGs are interpretable but also achieve equal or superior performance in
queries ranging from $L_1$ to $L_3$ in the causal hierarchy. For the continuous
case, TRAM-DAGs allow for counterfactual queries for three common causal
structures, including unobserved confounding.
