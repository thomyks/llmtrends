  interpretability",TMLR 2025,,,,cs.LG cs.AI cs.CV,http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/,"  High quality explanations of neural networks (NNs) should exhibit two key
properties. Completeness ensures that they accurately reflect a network's
function and interpretability makes them understandable to humans. Many
existing methods provide explanations of individual neurons within a network.
In this work we provide evidence that for AlexNet pretrained on ImageNet,
neuron-based explanation methods sacrifice both completeness and
interpretability compared to activation principal components. Neurons are a
poor basis for AlexNet embeddings because they don't account for the
distributed nature of these representations. By examining two quantitative
measures of completeness and conducting a user study to measure
interpretability, we show the most important principal components provide more
complete and interpretable explanations than the most important neurons. Much
of the activation variance may be explained by examining relatively few
high-variance PCs, as opposed to studying every neuron. These principal
components also strongly affect network function, and are significantly more
interpretable than neurons. Our findings suggest that explanation methods for
networks like AlexNet should avoid using neurons as a basis for embeddings and
instead choose a basis, such as principal components, which accounts for the
high dimensional and distributed nature of a network's internal
representations. Interactive demo and code available at

over constructive set theories, focusing on $\mathsf{IKP}$ and $\mathsf{CZF}$.
Most previously studied large set axioms, notably the constructive analogues of
large cardinals below $0^\sharp$, have proof-theoretic strength weaker than
full Second-order Arithmetic. On the other hand, the situation is dramatically
different for those defined via elementary embeddings. We show that by adding
to $\mathsf{IKP}$ the basic properties of an elementary embedding $j\colon V\to
M$ for $\Delta_0$-formulas, which we will denote by
$\mathsf{\Delta_0\text{-}BTEE}_M$, we obtain the consistency of $\mathsf{ZFC}$
and more. We will also see that the consistency strength of a Reinhardt set
exceeds that of $\mathsf{ZF+WA}$. Furthermore, we will define super Reinhardt
sets and $\mathsf{TR}$, which is a constructive analogue of $V$ being totally
Reinhardt, and prove that their proof-theoretic strength exceeds that of
$\mathsf{ZF}$ with choiceless large cardinals.

the critical group of a graph, we introduce a version of the critical group (or
sandpile group) for combinatorial maps, that is, for graphs embedded in
orientable surfaces. We provide several definitions of our critical group, by
approaching it through analogues of the cycle-cocycle matrix, the Laplacian
matrix, and as the group of critical states of a chip firing game (or sandpile
model) on the edges of a map.
  Our group can be regarded as a perturbation of the classical critical group
of its underlying graph by topological information, and it agrees with the
classical critical group in the plane case. Its cardinality is equal to the
number of spanning quasi-trees in a connected map, just as the cardinality of
the classical critical group is equal to the number of spanning trees of a
connected graph.
  Our approach exploits the properties of principally unimodular matrices and
the methods of delta-matroid theory.

  Let $(M,\mathcal{N})$ be a connected marked 3-manifold with

generalizable, highly efficient, and modular modality-fusion framework that can
incorporate any new modality to enhance video reasoning. We first augment
multiple informative modalities (such as optical flow, 3D point cloud, audio,
thermal heatmap, and touch map) from given videos without extra human
annotation by leveraging sensors or existing pre-trained models. Next, we
introduce a query transformer with multiple parameter-efficient modules

to the LLM token embedding space, allowing the model to integrate different
data types for response generation. Furthermore, we propose a novel progressive
multimodal fusion design supported by a lightweight fusion module and
modality-sequential training strategy. It helps compress information across
various assisting modalities, maintaining computational efficiency in the LLM
while improving performance. We validate our method on 7 video-language
reasoning tasks assisted by diverse modalities, including conventional VideoQA
and Video-Audio/3D/Touch/Thermal QA, and achieve better/equivalent performance
against strong multimodal LLMs, including OneLLM, BLIP-2, and SeViLA while
reducing over 90% trainable parameters. We provide extensive analyses of CREMA,

systems. In response to this, algorithms that leverage side information such as
review texts have been proposed. Furthermore, Cross-Domain Recommendation
(CDR), which captures domain-shareable knowledge and transfers it from a richer
domain (source) to a sparser one (target), has received notable attention.
Nevertheless, the majority of existing methodologies assume a Euclidean
embedding space, encountering difficulties in accurately representing richer
text information and managing complex interactions between users and items.
This paper advocates a hyperbolic CDR approach based on review texts for
modeling user-item relationships. We first emphasize that conventional
distance-based domain alignment techniques may cause problems because small
modifications in hyperbolic geometry result in magnified perturbations,
ultimately leading to the collapse of hierarchical structures. To address this
challenge, we propose hierarchy-aware embedding and domain alignment schemes
that adjust the scale to extract domain-shareable information without
disrupting structural forms. The process involves the initial embedding of
review texts in hyperbolic space, followed by feature extraction incorporating
degree-based normalization and structure alignment. We conducted extensive
experiments to substantiate the efficiency, robustness, and scalability of our
proposed model in comparison to state-of-the-art baselines.

lightweight, while achieving similar or better decoding performance. We further

reference image and conditioning text, enabling controllable image searches.
The mainstream Zero-Shot (ZS) CIR methods bypass the need for expensive
training CIR triplets by projecting image embeddings into the text token
embedding space, forming a composed query for retrieval. However, we highlight
an inherent limitation in these projection-based CIR: a task discrepancy of
text encoders between the original pre-training task of the encoders (text
$\leftrightarrow$ image) and the target CIR task (image + text
$\leftrightarrow$ image), which potentially negatively impacts CIR performance.
To reduce such a discrepancy, a naive solution would be to train both image and
text encoders with CIR triplets in a supervised manner. Instead, we introduce
Reducing Task Discrepancy of Text Encoders (RTD), an efficient text-only
post-hoc framework that complements projection-based CIR methods. We devise a
novel target-anchored text contrastive learning designed to enhance the
capability of the text encoder for CIR. We also propose two key enhancements:
(1) a hard negative-based refined batch sampling strategy and (2) a refined
concatenation scheme to further mitigate training-inference discrepancy.
Integrating RTD into state-of-the-art projection-based methods achieves
performance comparable to, or even surpassing, resource-intensive
state-of-the-art synthetic CIR triplet-based approaches only with 23 minutes of
additional training on 4 A100 GPUs (up to $100\times$ faster in training). Our

interpretability, allowing its application in both machine learning inference
and understanding of structure-property relationships. Our proposed material
encoding has two components: one representing the crystal structure and the
other characterizing the chemical composition, that we call Pettifor embedding.
For the latter we construct a non-orthogonal space where each axis represents a
chemical element and where the angle between the axes quantifies a measure of
the similarity between them. The chemical composition is then defined by the
point on the unit sphere in this non-orthogonal space. We show that the
Pettifor embeddings systematically outperform other commonly used elemental
embeddings in compositional machine learning models. Using the Pettifor
embeddings to define a distance metric and applying dimension reduction
techniques, we construct a two-dimensional global map of the space of
thermodynamically stable crystalline compounds. Despite their simplicity, such
maps succeed in providing a physical separation of material classes according
to basic physical properties.

Furthermore, WhosAI is model-agnostic and scalable to the release of new AI
text-generation models by incorporating their generated instances into the

matrix (CCM) estimation for frequency division duplexing (FDD) massive
multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) communication systems with base station
(BS) possessing a uniform linear array (ULA) antenna structure. We consider a
setting where the UL CCM is mapped to DL CCM by a mapping function. We first
present a theoretical error analysis of learning a nonlinear embedding by
constructing a mapping function, which points to the importance of the
Lipschitz regularity of the mapping function for achieving high estimation
performance. Then, based on the theoretical ground, we propose a representation
learning algorithm as a solution for the estimation problem, where Gaussian RBF
kernel interpolators are chosen to map UL CCMs to their DL counterparts. The
proposed algorithm is based on the optimization of an objective function that
fits a regression model between the DL CCM and UL CCM samples in the training
dataset and preserves the local geometric structure of the data in the UL CCM
space, while explicitly regulating the Lipschitz continuity of the mapping
function in light of our theoretical findings. The proposed algorithm surpasses
benchmark methods in terms of three error metrics as shown by simulations.

graph topology when mapping nodes to vector representations, enabling various
downstream tasks such as node classification and community detection. However,
most current graph neural network models face the challenge of requiring
extensive labeled data, which limits their practical applicability in
real-world scenarios where labeled data is scarce. To address this challenge,
researchers have explored Graph Contrastive Learning (GCL), which leverages
enhanced graph data and contrastive learning techniques. While promising,
existing GCL methods often struggle with effectively capturing both local and
global graph structures, and balancing the trade-off between nodelevel and
graph-level representations. In this work, we propose Graph Representation
Embedding Enhanced via Multidimensional Contrastive Learning (GRE2-MDCL). Our
model introduces a novel triple network architecture with a multi-head
attention GNN as the core. GRE2-MDCL first globally and locally augments the
input graph using SVD and LAGNN techniques. It then constructs a
multidimensional contrastive loss, incorporating cross-network, cross-view, and
neighbor contrast, to optimize the model. Extensive experiments on benchmark
datasets Cora, Citeseer, and PubMed demonstrate that GRE2-MDCL achieves
state-of-the-art performance, with average accuracies of 82.5%, 72.5%, and

aggregation and clearer inter-cluster boundaries, highlighting the
effectiveness of our framework in improving upon baseline GCL models.

facilitates the successful execution of long-horizon tasks. Evaluations across
extensive benchmarks demonstrate state-of-the-art or comparative performance in

diffusion models. While text-to-image (T2I) diffusion models can easily
generate out-of-distribution concepts like ``a blue banana'', they struggle
with generating combinatorial objects such as ``a creative mixture that
resembles a lettuce and a mantis'', due to difficulties in understanding the
semantic depth of ``creative''. Current methods rely heavily on synthesizing
reference prompts or images to achieve a creative effect, typically requiring
retraining for each unique creative output-a process that is computationally
intensive and limits practical applications. To address this, we introduce
CreTok, which brings meta-creativity to diffusion models by redefining
``creative'' as a new token, \texttt{<CreTok>}, thus enhancing models' semantic
understanding for combinatorial creativity. CreTok achieves such redefinition
by iteratively sampling diverse text pairs from our proposed CangJie dataset to
form adaptive prompts and restrictive prompts, and then optimizing the
similarity between their respective text embeddings. Extensive experiments
demonstrate that <CreTok> enables the universal and direct generation of
combinatorial creativity across diverse concepts without additional training,
achieving state-of-the-art performance with improved text-image alignment and
higher human preference ratings. Code will be made available at

essential for hazard assessment and advancing our understanding of seismic
activity in the region. A handy hypocenter determination tool incorporating a
realistic 3D velocity structure, accessible to the scientific community, is
beneficial. In this study, we developed HypoNet Nankai, a rapid hypocenter
determination tool based on a physics-informed neural network (PINN) emulator
(surrogate model) for travel time calculations. This tool leverages a PINN
trained to predict P-wave travel times between arbitrary underground sources
and surface receivers with a realistic 3D P-wave velocity structure model of
the Nankai Trough subduction zone that incorporates marine seismic survey data.
The PINN embeds physical laws, namely, the Eikonal equation, directly into the
loss function of training and circumvents the need for labeled training data.
To address the training challenges posed by small-scale features in the
velocity model, we employed a simple domain decomposition approach and Fourier
feature embedding. Once trained, the PINN immediately infers the P-wave travel
time, enabling rapid hypocenter determination. The data size required to store
NNs for travel time calculations is significantly smaller than those of
conventional travel-time tables. HypoNet Nankai provides high flexibility for
addition of new observation points. We verified HypoNet Nankai by comparing its
performance with a widely used grid-based numerical method for forward travel
time calculations and synthetic hypocenter determination. In both tests,
HypoNet Nankai provided results consistent with those for the conventional
method. HypoNet Nankai offers a rapid, accurate, and easy-to-use hypocenter
determination method for the Nankai Trough subduction zone, with greater data
efficiency and extendibility compared to conventional approaches.

are essential for instruction-based image editing. Predominant training
datasets (e.g., InsPix2Pix) are created using text-to-image generative models
(e.g., Stable Diffusion, DALL-E) which are not trained for image editing.
Accordingly, these datasets suffer from inaccurate instruction following, poor
detail preserving, and generation artifacts. In this paper, we propose to
address the training data quality issue with multi-perspective reward data
instead of refining the ground-truth image quality. 1) we first design a
quantitative metric system based on best-in-class LVLM (Large Vision Language
Model), i.e., GPT-4o in our case, to evaluate the generation quality from 3
perspectives, namely, instruction following, detail preserving, and generation
quality. For each perspective, we collected quantitative score in $0\sim 5$ and
text descriptive feedback on the specific failure points in ground-truth edited
images, resulting in a high-quality editing reward dataset, i.e.,
RewardEdit20K. 2) We further proposed a novel training framework to seamlessly
integrate the metric output, regarded as multi-reward, into editing models to
learn from the imperfect training triplets. During training, the reward scores
and text descriptions are encoded as embeddings and fed into both the latent
space and the U-Net of the editing models as auxiliary conditions. 3) We also
build a challenging evaluation benchmark with real-world images/photos and
diverse editing instructions, named Real-Edit. Experiments indicate that our
multi-reward conditioned model outperforms its no-reward counterpart on two
popular editing pipelines, i.e., InsPix2Pix and SmartEdit. Code is released at

some invertible matrix $T\in M_n$. In this paper we further extend the
aforementioned results in the context of structural matrix algebras (SMAs),
i.e. subalgebras $\mathcal{A}$ of $M_n$ that contain all diagonal matrices.
More precisely, we provide both a necessary and sufficient condition for an SMA
$\mathcal{A}\subseteq M_n$ such that any injective continuous commutativity and
spectrum preserving map $\phi: \mathcal{A} \to M_n$ is necessarily a Jordan
embedding. In contrast to the previous cases, such maps $\phi$ no longer need
to be multiplicative/antimultiplicative, nor rank-one preservers.

high-quality upstream encoders with a large amount of unlabeled data. However,
it is found to be susceptible to backdoor attacks merely via polluting a small
portion of training data. The victim encoders associate triggered inputs with
target embeddings, e.g., mapping a triggered cat image to an airplane
embedding, such that the downstream tasks inherit unintended behaviors when the
trigger is activated. Emerging backdoor attacks have shown great threats across
different SSL paradigms such as contrastive learning and CLIP, yet limited
research is devoted to defending against such attacks, and existing defenses
fall short in detecting advanced stealthy backdoors. To address the
limitations, we propose a novel detection mechanism, DeDe, which detects the
activation of backdoor mappings caused by triggered inputs on victim encoders.
Specifically, DeDe trains a decoder for any given SSL encoder using an
auxiliary dataset (which can be out-of-distribution or even slightly poisoned),
so that for any triggered input that misleads the encoder into the target
embedding, the decoder generates an output image significantly different from
the input. DeDe leverages the discrepancy between the input and the decoded
output to identify potential backdoor misbehavior during inference. We
empirically evaluate DeDe on both contrastive learning and CLIP models against
various types of backdoor attacks. Our results demonstrate promising detection

Project: https://liewfeng.github.io/TeaCache,,,,cs.CV,http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/,"  As a fundamental backbone for video generation, diffusion models are
challenged by low inference speed due to the sequential nature of denoising.
Previous methods speed up the models by caching and reusing model outputs at
uniformly selected timesteps. However, such a strategy neglects the fact that
differences among model outputs are not uniform across timesteps, which hinders
selecting the appropriate model outputs to cache, leading to a poor balance
between inference efficiency and visual quality. In this study, we introduce
Timestep Embedding Aware Cache (TeaCache), a training-free caching approach
that estimates and leverages the fluctuating differences among model outputs
across timesteps. Rather than directly using the time-consuming model outputs,
TeaCache focuses on model inputs, which have a strong correlation with the
modeloutputs while incurring negligible computational cost. TeaCache first
modulates the noisy inputs using the timestep embeddings to ensure their
differences better approximating those of model outputs. TeaCache then
introduces a rescaling strategy to refine the estimated differences and
utilizes them to indicate output caching. Experiments show that TeaCache
achieves up to 4.41x acceleration over Open-Sora-Plan with negligible (-0.07%
Vbench score) degradation of visual quality.

achieve high-accuracy extraction by leveraging CLIP's aligning capability and
rich representations, demonstrating exceptional capacity and efficiency. 2) We
tailor a Spherical-Harmonic-aware (SH-aware) Message Embedding module for 3DGS,
seamlessly embedding messages into the SH features of each 3D Gaussian while
preserving the original 3D structure. This enables watermarking 3DGS assets
with minimal fidelity trade-offs and prevents malicious users from removing the

Neural Networks (PINNs). Despite their straightforward optimization framework
and flexibility in implementing various PDEs, PINNs often suffer from limited
accuracy due to the spectral bias of Multi-Layer Perceptrons (MLPs), which
struggle to effectively learn high-frequency and nonlinear components.
Recently, parametric mesh representations in combination with neural networks
have been investigated as a promising approach to eliminate the inductive bias
of MLPs. However, they usually require high-resolution grids and a large number
of collocation points to achieve high accuracy while avoiding overfitting. In
addition, the fixed positions of the mesh parameters restrict their
flexibility, making accurate approximation of complex PDEs challenging. To
overcome these limitations, we propose Physics-Informed Gaussians (PIGs), which
combine feature embeddings using Gaussian functions with a lightweight neural

each Gaussian, allowing for dynamic adjustment of their positions and shapes
during training. This adaptability enables our model to optimally approximate
PDE solutions, unlike models with fixed parameter positions. Furthermore, the
proposed approach maintains the same optimization framework used in PINNs,
allowing us to benefit from their excellent properties. Experimental results

study investigates how vision-language models (VLMs) handle image-understanding

models vary in how information is exchanged from visual to textual tokens. VLMs
that only output text exhibit a distributed communication pattern, where
information is exchanged through multiple image tokens. In contrast, models
trained for image and text generation tend to rely on a single token that acts
as a narrow gate for visual information. We demonstrate that ablating this
single token significantly deteriorates performance on image understanding
tasks. Furthermore, modifying this token enables effective steering of the
image semantics, showing that targeted, local interventions can reliably
control the model's global behavior.

challenges can now be modeled using generative paradigms and leverage the
robust generative and comprehension capabilities of large language models
(LLMs), numerous practical applications - such as semantic matching,
clustering, and information retrieval - continue to rely on text embeddings for
their efficiency and effectiveness. Therefore, integrating LLMs with text
embeddings has become a major research focus in recent years. In this survey,
we categorize the interplay between LLMs and text embeddings into three
overarching themes: (1) LLM-augmented text embedding, enhancing traditional
embedding methods with LLMs; (2) LLMs as text embedders, adapting their innate
capabilities for high-quality embedding; and (3) Text embedding understanding
with LLMs, leveraging LLMs to analyze and interpret embeddings. By organizing
recent works based on interaction patterns rather than specific downstream
applications, we offer a novel and systematic overview of contributions from
various research and application domains in the era of LLMs. Furthermore, we
highlight the unresolved challenges that persisted in the pre-LLM era with
pre-trained language models (PLMs) and explore the emerging obstacles brought
forth by LLMs. Building on this analysis, we outline prospective directions for
the evolution of text embedding, addressing both theoretical and practical
opportunities in the rapidly advancing landscape of NLP.

capture excess returns from mispricing. Recently, we have witnessed the rise of
variational autoencoder-based latent factor models, which learn latent factors
self-adaptively. While these models focus on modeling overall market
conditions, they often fail to effectively capture the temporal patterns of
individual stocks. Additionally, representing multiple factors as single values
simplifies the model but limits its ability to capture complex relationships
and dependencies. As a result, the learned factors are of low quality and lack
diversity, reducing their effectiveness and robustness across different trading
periods. To address these issues, we propose a Spatio-Temporal factOR Model
based on dual vector quantized variational autoencoders, named STORM, which
extracts features of stocks from temporal and spatial perspectives, then fuses
and aligns these features at the fine-grained and semantic level, and
represents the factors as multi-dimensional embeddings. The discrete codebooks
cluster similar factor embeddings, ensuring orthogonality and diversity, which
helps distinguish between different factors and enables factor selection in
financial trading. To show the performance of the proposed factor model, we
apply it to two downstream experiments: portfolio management on two stock
datasets and individual trading tasks on six specific stocks. The extensive
experiments demonstrate STORM's flexibility in adapting to downstream tasks and
superior performance over baseline models.

efficient recommendation, e.g., on-device recommendation, under memory

lightweight embeddings for both users and items, or involved on-device systems
enjoying the compact embeddings to enhance reusability and reduces space
complexity. However, they focus solely on the coarse granularity of embedding,
while overlook the fine-grained semantic nuances, to adversarially downgrade
the efficacy of meta-embeddings in capturing the intricate relationship over
both user and item, consequently resulting into the suboptimal recommendations.
In this paper, we aim to study how the meta-embedding can efficiently learn
varied grained semantics, together with how the fine-grained meta-embedding can
strengthen the representation of coarse-grained meta-embedding. To answer these
questions, we develop a novel graph neural networks (GNNs) based recommender
where each user and item serves as the node, linked directly to coarse-grained
virtual nodes and indirectly to fine-grained virtual nodes, ensuring different
grained semantic learning, while disclosing: 1) In contrast to coarse-grained
semantics, fine-grained semantics are well captured through sparse
meta-embeddings, which adaptively 2) balance the embedding uniqueness and
memory constraint. Additionally, the initialization method come up upon
SparsePCA, along with a soft thresholding activation function to render the
sparseness of the meta-embeddings. We propose a weight bridging update strategy

exploiting the GNN architecture, we show that the structure of interactions in

Further, current techniques which address such limitations fail to account for
the contribution of node embeddings to a certain prediction in the absence of

predictive framework for graph SSL that eliminates contrastive objectives and
negative sampling while preserving semantic and structural information.
Additionally, we introduce a semantic-aware objective term that incorporates

recognition (OSR), which enables the identification of input data not only from
classes known during training but also from unknown classes that might be

due to the reliance on complex generative models or suffer from high training
costs. We investigate OSR from a representation-learning perspective,
specifically through spherical embeddings. We introduce SphOR, a
computationally efficient representation learning method that models the
feature space as a mixture of von Mises-Fisher distributions. This approach
enables the use of semantically ambiguous samples during training, to improve
the detection of samples from unknown classes. We further explore the
relationship between OSR performance and key representation learning properties
which influence how well features are structured in high-dimensional space.
Extensive experiments on multiple OSR benchmarks demonstrate the effectiveness

controlling cluster boundaries and inter-cluster distance. Attraction is more
subtle, as attractive tension between points can manifest simultaneously as
attraction and repulsion in the lower-dimensional mapping. This explains the
need for learning rate annealing and motivates the different treatments between
attractive and repulsive terms. Moreover, by modifying attraction, we improve
the consistency of cluster formation under random initialization. Overall, our

  Conditional Variational AutoEncoder",Accepted by CVPR2025,,,,cs.CV,http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/,"  The integrative analysis of histopathological images and genomic data has
received increasing attention for survival prediction of human cancers.
However, the existing studies always hold the assumption that full modalities
are available. As a matter of fact, the cost for collecting genomic data is
high, which sometimes makes genomic data unavailable in testing samples. A
common way of tackling such incompleteness is to generate the genomic
representations from the pathology images. Nevertheless, such strategy still
faces the following two challenges: (1) The gigapixel whole slide images (WSIs)
are huge and thus hard for representation. (2) It is difficult to generate the
genomic embeddings with diverse function categories in a unified generative
framework. To address the above challenges, we propose a Conditional Latent
Differentiation Variational AutoEncoder (LD-CVAE) for robust multimodal
survival prediction, even with missing genomic data. Specifically, a
Variational Information Bottleneck Transformer (VIB-Trans) module is proposed
to learn compressed pathological representations from the gigapixel WSIs. To
generate different functional genomic features, we develop a novel Latent
Differentiation Variational AutoEncoder (LD-VAE) to learn the common and
specific posteriors for the genomic embeddings with diverse functions. Finally,
we use the product-of-experts technique to integrate the genomic common
posterior and image posterior for the joint latent distribution estimation in
LD-CVAE. We test the effectiveness of our method on five different cancer
datasets, and the experimental results demonstrate its superiority in both
complete and missing modality scenarios.

While conventional approaches treat the text modality as a conditioning signal
that gradually guides the denoising process from Gaussian noise to the target
image modality, we explore a much simpler paradigm-directly evolving between
text and image modalities through flow matching. This requires projecting both
modalities into a shared latent space, which poses a significant challenge due
to their inherently different representations: text is highly semantic and
encoded as 1D tokens, whereas images are spatially redundant and represented as
2D latent embeddings. To address this, we introduce FlowTok, a minimal
framework that seamlessly flows across text and images by encoding images into
a compact 1D token representation. Compared to prior methods, this design
reduces the latent space size by 3.3x at an image resolution of 256,
eliminating the need for complex conditioning mechanisms or noise scheduling.
Moreover, FlowTok naturally extends to image-to-text generation under the same
formulation. With its streamlined architecture centered around compact 1D
tokens, FlowTok is highly memory-efficient, requires significantly fewer
training resources, and achieves much faster sampling speeds-all while
delivering performance comparable to state-of-the-art models. Code will be

the diffusion process on a disparity-aware coordinate embedding and a warped

Residual Vector Quantization, which not only maximizes the capacity of the

end-cloud collaboration, where the end device retrieves useful information from
cloud databases to enhance local processing, known as Retrieval-Augmented
Generation (RAG). Typically, to retrieve information from the cloud while
safeguarding privacy, the end device transforms original data into embeddings
with a local embedding model. However, the recently emerging Embedding
Inversion Attacks (EIAs) can still recover the original data from text
embeddings (e.g., training a recovery model to map embeddings back to original
texts), posing a significant threat to user privacy. To address this risk, we
propose EntroGuard, an entropy-driven perturbation-based embedding privacy
protection method, which can protect the privacy of text embeddings while
maintaining retrieval accuracy during the end-cloud collaboration.
Specifically, to defeat various EIAs, we perturb the embeddings to increase the
entropy of the recovered text in the common structure of recovery models, thus
steering the embeddings toward meaningless texts rather than original sensitive
texts during the recovery process. To maintain retrieval performance in the
cloud, we constrain the perturbations within a bound, applying the strategy of
reducing them where redundant and increasing them where sparse. Moreover,
EntroGuard can be directly integrated into end devices without requiring any
modifications to the embedding model. Extensive experimental results
demonstrate that EntroGuard can reduce the risk of privacy leakage by up to 8
times at most with negligible loss of retrieval performance compared to
existing privacy-preserving methods.

the required continuity. A natural progression would be to leverage more recent
pre-trained text-to-video (T2V) models. This approach is rendered more
challenging by the fact that the most common fine-tuning technique, low-rank
adaptation (LoRA), yields undesirable results. In this work, we propose an
adaptation-based strategy we label Frame-wise Conditioning Adaptation (FCA).
Within the module, we devise a sub-module that produces frame-wise text
embeddings from the input text, which acts as an additional text condition to
aid generation. We use FCA to fine-tune the T2V model, which incorporates the
initial frame(s) as an extra condition. We compare and discuss the more
effective strategy for injecting such embeddings into the T2V model. We conduct
extensive ablation studies on our design choices with quantitative and
qualitative performance analysis. Our approach establishes a new
state-of-the-art for the task of TVP. The project page is at

such platforms to find new solutions to address this problem. Various methods
have been proposed to automate this task in the past decade. Most of them rely
on the exchanged content, but ignore the structure and dynamics of the
conversation, which could provide some relevant information. In this article,
we propose to use representation learning methods to automatically produce
embeddings of this textual content and of the conversational graphs depicting
message exchanges. While the latter could be enhanced by including additional
information on top of the raw conversational structure, no method currently
exists to learn wholegraph representations using simultaneously edge
directions, weights, signs, and vertex attributes. We propose two such methods
to fill this gap in the literature. We experiment with 5 textual and 13 graph
embedding methods, and apply them to a dataset of online messages annotated for
abuse detection. Our best results achieve an F -measure of 81.02 using text
alone and 80.61 using graphs alone. We also combine both modalities of
information (text and graphs) through three fusion strategies, and show that
this strongly improves abuse detection performance, increasing the F -measure
to 87.06. Finally, we identify which specific engineered features are captured
by the embedding methods under consideration. These features have clear
interpretations and help explain what information the representation learning
methods deem discriminative.

performance degradation of pre-trained models caused by domain shifts, it often
falls short in real-world deployment. Test-time adaptation (TTA), which adjusts
a learned model using unlabeled test data, presents a promising solution.
However, most existing TTA methods struggle to deliver strong performance in
medical image segmentation, primarily because they overlook the crucial prior
knowledge inherent to medical images. To address this challenge, we incorporate
morphological information and propose a framework based on multi-graph
matching. Specifically, we introduce learnable universe embeddings that
integrate morphological priors during multi-source training, along with novel
unsupervised test-time paradigms for domain adaptation. This approach
guarantees cycle-consistency in multi-matching while enabling the model to more

mitigating the effects of domain shifts. Extensive experiments demonstrate that

challenging but critical task. Previous systems have primarily focused on the
weak correlation between audio and gestures, leading to physically unnatural
outcomes that degrade the user experience. To address this problem, we
introduce HoleGest, a novel neural network framework based on decoupled

expressive co-speech gestures. Our system leverages large-scale human motion
datasets to learn a robust prior with low audio dependency and high motion
reliance, enabling stable global motion and detailed finger movements. To
improve the generation efficiency of diffusion-based models, we integrate
implicit joint constraints with explicit geometric and conditional constraints,
capturing complex motion distributions between large strides. This integration
significantly enhances generation speed while maintaining high-quality motion.
Furthermore, we design a shared embedding space for gesture-transcription text
alignment, enabling the generation of semantically correct gesture actions.

minimal supervision during the fine-tuning (SFT) stage (Zhou et al., 2024) has
been substantiated by recent advancements in data curation and selection
research. However, their stability and generalizability are compromised due to
the vulnerability to experimental setups and validation protocols, falling
short of surpassing random sampling (Diddee & Ippolito, 2024; Xia et al.,
2024b). Built upon LLMs, multi-modal LLMs (MLLMs), combined with the sheer
token volume and heightened heterogeneity of data sources, amplify both the
significance and complexity of data selection.
  To harvest multi-modal instructional data in a robust and efficient manner,
we re-define the granularity of the quality metric by decomposing it into 14
vision-language-related capabilities, and introduce multi-modal rich scorers to
evaluate the capabilities of each data candidate. To promote diversity, in
light of the inherent objective of the alignment stage, we take interaction
style as diversity indicator and use a multi-modal rich styler to identify data
instruction patterns. In doing so, our multi-modal rich scorers and styler
(mmSSR) guarantee that high-scoring information is conveyed to users in
diversified forms. Free from embedding-based clustering or greedy sampling,
mmSSR efficiently scales to millions of data with varying budget constraints,
supports customization for general or specific capability acquisition, and
facilitates training-free generalization to new domains for curation. Across
10+ experimental settings, validated by 14 multi-modal benchmarks, we
demonstrate consistent improvements over random sampling, baseline strategies

  Time",Extended version of AAAI 2025,,,,cs.DS,http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/,"  Efficiently computing accurate representations of high-dimensional data is
essential for data analysis and unsupervised learning. Dendrograms, also known
as ultrametrics, are widely used representations that preserve hierarchical
relationships within the data. However, popular methods for computing them,
such as linkage algorithms, suffer from quadratic time and space complexity,
making them impractical for large datasets.
  The ""best ultrametric embedding"" (a.k.a. ""best ultrametric fit"") problem,
which aims to find the ultrametric that best preserves the distances between
points in the original data, is known to require at least quadratic time for an
exact solution.
  Recent work has focused on improving scalability by approximating optimal
solutions in subquadratic time, resulting in a $(\sqrt{2} +
\epsilon)$-approximation (Cohen-Addad, de Joannis de Verclos and Lagarde,
2021).
  In this paper, we present the first subquadratic algorithm that achieves
arbitrarily precise approximations of the optimal ultrametric embedding.
Specifically, we provide an algorithm that, for any $c \geq 1$, outputs a
$c$-approximation of the best ultrametric in time $\tilde{O}(n^{1 + 1/c})$. In
particular, for any fixed $\epsilon > 0$, the algorithm computes a
$(1+\epsilon)$-approximation in time $\tilde{O}(n^{2 - \epsilon +
o(\epsilon^2)})$.
  Experimental results show that our algorithm improves upon previous methods
in terms of approximation quality while maintaining comparable running times.

  methods with a W-shaped network for high-dimensional games",46 pages,,,,cs.LG cs.AI,http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/,"  Studies in reward shaping for reinforcement learning (RL) have flourished in
recent years due to its ability to speed up training. Our previous work
proposed an adaptive potential function (APF) and showed that APF can
accelerate the Q-learning with a Multi-layer Perceptron algorithm in the
low-dimensional domain. This paper proposes to extend APF with an encoder
(APF+) for RL state representation, allowing applying APF to the pixel-based
Atari games using a state-encoding method that projects high-dimensional game's
pixel frames to low-dimensional embeddings. We approach by designing the
state-representation encoder as a W-shaped network (W-Net), by using which we
are able to encode both the background as well as the moving entities in the
game frames. Specifically, the embeddings derived from the pre-trained W-Net
consist of two latent vectors: One represents the input state, and the other
represents the deviation of the input state's representation from itself. We
then incorporate W-Net into APF to train a downstream Dueling Deep Q-Network
(DDQN), obtain the APF-WNet-DDQN, and demonstrate its effectiveness in Atari
game-playing tasks. To evaluate the APF+W-Net module in such high-dimensional
tasks, we compare with two types of baseline methods: (i) the basic DDQN; and
(ii) two encoder-replaced APF-DDQN methods where we replace W-Net by (a) an
unsupervised state representation method called Spatiotemporal Deep Infomax
(ST-DIM) and (b) a ground truth state representation provided by the Atari
Annotated RAM Interface (ARI). The experiment results show that out of 20 Atari
games, APF-WNet-DDQN outperforms DDQN (14/20 games) and APF-STDIM-DDQN (13/20
games) significantly. In comparison against the APF-ARI-DDQN which employs
embeddings directly of the detailed game-internal state information, the
APF-WNet-DDQN achieves a comparable performance.

  Submitted to an Elsevier journal",,,,cs.LG cs.CV,http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/,"  We present a supervised dimensionality reduction technique called Convex
Linear Discriminant Analysis (ConvexLDA). The proposed model optimizes a
multi-objective cost function by balancing two complementary terms. The first
term pulls the samples of a class towards its centroid by minimizing a sample's
distance from its class-centroid in low dimensional space. The second term
pushes the classes far apart by maximizing their hyperellipsoid scattering
volume via the logarithm of the determinant (\textit{log det}) of the outer
product matrix formed by the low-dimensional class-centroids. Using the
negative of the \textit{log det}, we pose the final cost as a minimization
problem, which balances the two terms using a hyper-parameter $\lambda$. We
demonstrate that the cost function is convex. Unlike Fisher LDA, the proposed
method doesn't require to compute the inverse of a matrix, hence avoiding any
ill-conditioned problem where data dimension is very high, e.g. RNA-seq data.
ConvexLDA doesn't require pair-wise distance calculation, making it faster and
more easily scalable. Moreover, the convex nature of the cost function ensures
global optimality, enhancing the reliability of the learned embedding. Our
experimental evaluation demonstrates that ConvexLDA outperforms several popular
linear discriminant analysis (LDA)-based methods on a range of high-dimensional
biological data, image data sets, etc.

performance, the high-dimensional embeddings and vast number of primitives lead
to substantial storage requirements. In this paper, we introduce a
\textbf{Light}weight \textbf{4}D\textbf{GS} framework, called Light4GS, that
employs significance pruning with a deep context model to provide a lightweight
storage-efficient dynamic 3DGS representation. The proposed Light4GS is based
on 4DGS that is a typical representation of deformable 3DGS. Specifically, our
framework is built upon two core components: (1) a spatio-temporal significance
pruning strategy that eliminates over 64\% of the deformable primitives,
followed by an entropy-constrained spherical harmonics compression applied to
the remainder; and (2) a deep context model that integrates intra- and
inter-prediction with hyperprior into a coarse-to-fine context structure to
enable efficient multiscale latent embedding compression. Our approach achieves
over 120x compression and increases rendering FPS up to 20\% compared to the
baseline 4DGS, and also superior to frame-wise state-of-the-art 3DGS
compression methods, revealing the effectiveness of our Light4GS in terms of
both intra- and inter-prediction methods without sacrificing rendering quality.

difficulty in separating intra-cluster and inter-cluster structures in
high-dimensional manifold embedding, we proposes an Adaptive Multi-Scale

ordinal distance overcomes the constraints of the curse of dimensionality in
high-dimensional spaces, effectively distinguishing heterogeneous samples. We
design an adaptive neighborhood adjustment method to construct similarity
graphs that simultaneously balance intra-cluster compactness and inter-cluster
separability. Furthermore, we develop a two-stage embedding framework: the
first stage achieves preliminary cluster separation while preserving
connectivity between structurally similar clusters via the similarity graph,
and the second stage enhances inter-cluster separation through a label-driven
distance reweighting. Experimental results demonstrate that AMSME significantly
preserves intra-cluster topological structures and improves inter-cluster
separation on real-world datasets. Additionally, leveraging its
multi-resolution analysis capability, AMSME discovers novel neuronal subtypes
in the mouse lumbar dorsal root ganglion scRNA-seq dataset, with marker gene
analysis revealing their distinct biological roles.

Moreover, these approaches fall short in temporal reasoning, merely aggregating
frame-level predictions over a temporal context. In response, we introduce
DIFFVSGG, an online VSGG solution that frames this task as an iterative scene
graph update problem. Drawing inspiration from Latent Diffusion Models (LDMs)
which generate images via denoising a latent feature embedding, we unify the
decoding of object classification, bounding box regression, and graph
generation three tasks using one shared feature embedding. Then, given an
embedding containing unified features of object pairs, we conduct a step-wise
Denoising on it within LDMs, so as to deliver a clean embedding which clearly
indicates the relationships between objects. This embedding then serves as the
input to task-specific heads for object classification, scene graph generation,
etc. DIFFVSGG further facilitates continuous temporal reasoning, where
predictions for subsequent frames leverage results of past frames as the
conditional inputs of LDMs, to guide the reverse diffusion process for current
frames. Extensive experiments on three setups of Action Genome demonstrate the
superiority of DIFFVSGG.

motion-text-audio-aligned variational autoencoder (MTA-VAE), which leverages
pre-trained WavCaps' text and audio embeddings to enhance both semantic and
rhythmic alignment with motion, ultimately producing more realistic gestures.
(2) Building on this, we propose a multimodal masked autoregressive model

models, are deployed worldwide for identity verification and facial attribute
analysis. The performance of these models is determined by a complex
interdependence among the model architecture, optimization/loss function and
datasets. Although FRSs have surpassed human-level accuracy, they continue to
be disparate against certain demographics. Due to the ubiquity of applications,
it is extremely important to understand the impact of the three components --
model architecture, loss function and face image dataset on the
accuracy-disparity trade-off to design better, unbiased platforms. In this
work, we perform an in-depth analysis of three FRSs for the task of gender
prediction, with various architectural modifications resulting in ten
deep-learning models coupled with four loss functions and benchmark them on
seven face datasets across 266 evaluation configurations. Our results show that
all three components have an individual as well as a combined impact on both
accuracy and disparity. We identify that datasets have an inherent property
that causes them to perform similarly across models, independent of the choice
of loss functions. Moreover, the choice of dataset determines the model's
perceived bias -- the same model reports bias in opposite directions for three
gender-balanced datasets of ``in-the-wild'' face images of popular individuals.
Studying the facial embeddings shows that the models are unable to generalize a
uniform definition of what constitutes a ``female face'' as opposed to a ``male
face'', due to dataset diversity. We provide recommendations to model
developers on using our study as a blueprint for model development and
subsequent deployment.

image generation, enabling significant progress in stylized generation using
only a few style reference images. However, current diffusion-based methods
struggle with fine-grained style customization due to challenges in controlling
multiple style attributes, such as color and texture. This paper introduces the
first tuning-free approach to achieve free-lunch color-texture disentanglement
in stylized T2I generation, addressing the need for independently controlled
style elements for the Disentangled Stylized Image Generation (DisIG) problem.
Our approach leverages the Image-Prompt Additivity property in the CLIP image
embedding space to develop techniques for separating and extracting
Color-Texture Embeddings (CTE) from individual color and texture reference
images. To ensure that the color palette of the generated image aligns closely
with the color reference, we apply a whitening and coloring transformation to
enhance color consistency. Additionally, to prevent texture loss due to the
signal-leak bias inherent in diffusion training, we introduce a noise term that
preserves textural fidelity during the Regularized Whitening and Coloring
Transformation (RegWCT). Through these methods, our Style Attributes
Disentanglement approach (SADis) delivers a more precise and customizable

structural relationships between voxel embeddings. The intra-class variations
are explored by clustering voxels along the distribution of multiple prototypes

Subsequently, we demonstrate that current approaches overestimate FL's

rigid skeletal motion with an oversimplified non-rigid motion model, which
fails to capture fine geometric and appearance details. Additionally, they
perform densification based solely on per-point gradients and process poses
independently, ignoring spatial and temporal correlations. These limitations
lead to geometric detail loss, temporal instability, and inefficient point
distribution. To address these issues, we propose HandSplat, a novel Gaussian
Splatting-based framework that enhances both fidelity and stability for hand
rendering. To improve fidelity, we extend standard 3DGS attributes with
implicit geometry and appearance embeddings for finer non-rigid motion modeling
while preserving the static hand characteristic modeled by original 3DGS
attributes. Additionally, we introduce a local gradient-aware densification
strategy that dynamically refines Gaussian density in high-variation regions.
To improve stability, we incorporate pose-conditioned attribute regularization
to encourage attribute consistency across similar poses, mitigating temporal
artifacts. Extensive experiments on InterHand2.6M demonstrate that HandSplat
surpasses existing methods in fidelity and stability while achieving real-time
performance. We will release the code and pre-trained models upon acceptance.

sets assembles into a Connes-Consani $\mathbb{F}_1$-module, with the collection
of partitions of finite sets as a sub-module. The underlying simplicial set of
this $\mathbb{F}_1$-module is shown to be isomorphic to the delooping of the
Krasner hyperfield $\mathbb{K}$, where $1+1=\{0,1\}$. The face and degeneracy
maps of the underlying simplicial set of the $\mathbb{F}_1$-module of
partitions correspond to merging partition blocks and introducing singleton
blocks, respectively. I also show that the $\mathbb{F}_1$-module of partitions
cannot correspond to a set with a binary operation (even partially defined or
multivalued) under the ``Eilenberg-MacLane'' embedding. These results imply
that the $n$-fold sum of the Dynkin $\mathbb{F}_1$-module with itself is
isomorphic to the $\mathbb{F}_1$-module of the discrete projective geometry on
$n$ points.

  Backward-Compatible Learning",,,,,cs.CV,http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/,"  The traditional paradigm to update retrieval models requires re-computing the
embeddings of the gallery data, a time-consuming and computationally intensive
process known as backfilling. To circumvent backfilling, Backward-Compatible
Learning (BCL) has been widely explored, which aims to train a new model
compatible with the old one. Many previous works focus on effectively aligning
the embeddings of the new model with those of the old one to enhance the
backward-compatibility. Nevertheless, such strong alignment constraints would
compromise the discriminative ability of the new model, particularly when
different classes are closely clustered and hard to distinguish in the old
feature space. To address this issue, we propose to relax the constraints by
introducing perturbations to the old feature prototypes. This allows us to
align the new feature space with a pseudo-old feature space defined by these
perturbed prototypes, thereby preserving the discriminative ability of the new
model in backward-compatible learning. We have developed two approaches for
calculating the perturbations: Neighbor-Driven Prototype Perturbation (NDPP)
and Optimization-Driven Prototype Perturbation (ODPP). Particularly, they take
into account the feature distributions of not only the old but also the new
models to obtain proper perturbations along with new model updating. Extensive
experiments on the landmark and commodity datasets demonstrate that our
approaches perform favorably against state-of-the-art BCL algorithms.

  Backpropagation",,,,,cs.CV cs.AI,http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-sa/4.0/,"  Diffusion models have shown remarkable performance in image synthesis, but
they demand extensive computational and memory resources for training,
fine-tuning and inference. Although advanced quantization techniques have
successfully minimized memory usage for inference, training and fine-tuning
these quantized models still require large memory possibly due to
dequantization for accurate computation of gradients and/or backpropagation for
gradient-based algorithms. However, memory-efficient fine-tuning is
particularly desirable for applications such as personalization that often must
be run on edge devices like mobile phones with private data. In this work, we
address this challenge by quantizing a diffusion model with personalization via
Textual Inversion and by leveraging a zeroth-order optimization on
personalization tokens without dequantization so that it does not require
gradient and activation storage for backpropagation that consumes considerable
memory. Since a gradient estimation using zeroth-order optimization is quite
noisy for a single or a few images in personalization, we propose to denoise
the estimated gradient by projecting it onto a subspace that is constructed
with the past history of the tokens, dubbed Subspace Gradient. In addition, we
investigated the influence of text embedding in image generation, leading to
our proposed time steps sampling, dubbed Partial Uniform Timestep Sampling for
sampling with effective diffusion timesteps. Our method achieves comparable
performance to prior methods in image and text alignment scores for
personalizing Stable Diffusion with only forward passes while reducing training
memory demand up to $8.2\times$.

  Heterogeneous Federated Learning",,,,,cs.LG,http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/,"  Federated learning (FL) algorithms commonly aim to maximize clients' accuracy
by training a model on their collective data. However, in several FL
applications, the model's decisions should meet a group fairness constraint to
be independent of sensitive attributes such as gender or race. While such group
fairness constraints can be incorporated into the objective function of the FL
optimization problem, in this work, we show that such an approach would lead to
suboptimal classification accuracy in an FL setting with heterogeneous client
distributions. To achieve an optimal accuracy-group fairness trade-off, we
propose the Personalized Federated Learning for Client-Level Group Fairness
(pFedFair) framework, where clients locally impose their fairness constraints
over the distributed training process. Leveraging the image embedding models,
we extend the application of pFedFair to computer vision settings, where we
numerically show that pFedFair achieves an optimal group fairness-accuracy
trade-off in heterogeneous FL settings. We present the results of several
numerical experiments on benchmark and synthetic datasets, which highlight the
suboptimality of non-personalized FL algorithms and the improvements made by
the pFedFair method.

segmentation, which requires separating foreground and background pixels
throughout a video given only the mask annotation of the first frame. To
address this problem, we propose a temporal contrastive memory network
comprising image and mask encoders to learn feature representations, a temporal
contrastive memory bank that aligns embeddings from adjacent frames while
pushing apart distant ones to explicitly model inter-frame relationships and
stores these features, and a decoder that fuses encoded image features and
memory readouts for segmentation. We also collect a diverse, multi-source
medical video dataset spanning various modalities and anatomies to benchmark
this task. Extensive experiments demonstrate state-of-the-art performance in
segmenting both seen and unseen structures from a single exemplar, showing
ability to generalize from scarce labels. This highlights the potential to
alleviate annotation burdens for medical video analysis. Code is available at

  Interaction Modeling",,,,,cs.RO cs.CV,http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/,"  Accurate and efficient modeling of agent interactions is essential for
trajectory generation, the core of autonomous driving systems. Existing
methods, scene-centric, agent-centric, and query-centric frameworks, each
present distinct advantages and drawbacks, creating an impossible triangle
among accuracy, computational time, and memory efficiency. To break this
limitation, we propose Directional Rotary Position Embedding (DRoPE), a novel
adaptation of Rotary Position Embedding (RoPE), originally developed in natural
language processing. Unlike traditional relative position embedding (RPE),
which introduces significant space complexity, RoPE efficiently encodes
relative positions without explicitly increasing complexity but faces inherent
limitations in handling angular information due to periodicity. DRoPE overcomes
this limitation by introducing a uniform identity scalar into RoPE's 2D rotary
transformation, aligning rotation angles with realistic agent headings to
naturally encode relative angular information. We theoretically analyze DRoPE's
correctness and efficiency, demonstrating its capability to simultaneously
optimize trajectory generation accuracy, time complexity, and space complexity.
Empirical evaluations compared with various state-of-the-art trajectory
generation models, confirm DRoPE's good performance and significantly reduced
space complexity, indicating both theoretical soundness and practical
effectiveness. The video documentation is available at

high-dimensional, multi-modal data sets that include imaging and spectroscopic
information for millions of galaxies. These data serve as an ideal benchmark
for large, pre-trained multi-modal models, which can leverage vast amounts of
unlabelled data. In this work, we present the first exploration of Euclid data
with AstroPT, an autoregressive multi-modal foundation model trained on
approximately 300 000 optical and infrared Euclid images and spectral energy
distributions (SEDs) from the first Euclid Quick Data Release. We compare
self-supervised pre-training with baseline fully supervised training across
several tasks: galaxy morphology classification; redshift estimation;
similarity searches; and outlier detection. Our results show that: (a) AstroPT
embeddings are highly informative, correlating with morphology and effectively
isolating outliers; (b) including infrared data helps to isolate stars, but
degrades the identification of edge-on galaxies, which are better captured by
optical images; (c) simple fine-tuning of these embeddings for photometric
redshift and stellar mass estimation outperforms a fully supervised approach,
even when using only 1% of the training labels; and (d) incorporating SED data
into AstroPT via a straightforward multi-modal token-chaining method improves
photo-z predictions, and allow us to identify potentially more interesting

  High-Accuracy Clinical Trial Patient Matching leveraging EHR data",,,,,cs.CL cs.AI,http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/,"  Background: Patient recruitment in clinical trials is hindered by complex
eligibility criteria and labor-intensive chart reviews. Prior research using
text-only models have struggled to address this problem in a reliable and
scalable way due to (1) limited reasoning capabilities, (2) information loss
from converting visual records to text, and (3) lack of a generic EHR
integration to extract patient data.
  Methods: We introduce a broadly applicable, integration-free, LLM-powered
pipeline that automates patient-trial matching using unprocessed documents
extracted from EHRs. Our approach leverages (1) the new reasoning-LLM paradigm,
enabling the assessment of even the most complex criteria, (2) visual
capabilities of latest LLMs to interpret medical records without lossy
image-to-text conversions, and (3) multimodal embeddings for efficient medical
record search. The pipeline was validated on the n2c2 2018 cohort selection
dataset (288 diabetic patients) and a real-world dataset composed of 485
patients from 30 different sites matched against 36 diverse trials.
  Results: On the n2c2 dataset, our method achieved a new state-of-the-art
criterion-level accuracy of 93\%. In real-world trials, the pipeline yielded an
accuracy of 87\%, undermined by the difficulty to replicate human
decision-making when medical records lack sufficient information. Nevertheless,
users were able to review overall eligibility in under 9 minutes per patient on
average, representing an 80\% improvement over traditional manual chart
reviews.
  Conclusion: This pipeline demonstrates robust performance in clinical trial
patient matching without requiring custom integration with site systems or
trial-specific tailoring, thereby enabling scalable deployment across sites
seeking to leverage AI for patient matching.

  https://cvlab-kaist.github.io/Visual-Persona",,,,cs.CV,http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/,"  We introduce Visual Persona, a foundation model for text-to-image full-body
human customization that, given a single in-the-wild human image, generates
diverse images of the individual guided by text descriptions. Unlike prior
methods that focus solely on preserving facial identity, our approach captures
detailed full-body appearance, aligning with text descriptions for body
structure and scene variations. Training this model requires large-scale paired
human data, consisting of multiple images per individual with consistent
full-body identities, which is notoriously difficult to obtain. To address
this, we propose a data curation pipeline leveraging vision-language models to
evaluate full-body appearance consistency, resulting in Visual Persona-500K, a
dataset of 580k paired human images across 100k unique identities. For precise
appearance transfer, we introduce a transformer encoder-decoder architecture
adapted to a pre-trained text-to-image diffusion model, which augments the
input image into distinct body regions, encodes these regions as local
appearance features, and projects them into dense identity embeddings
independently to condition the diffusion model for synthesizing customized
images. Visual Persona consistently surpasses existing approaches, generating
high-quality, customized images from in-the-wild inputs. Extensive ablation
studies validate design choices, and we demonstrate the versatility of Visual
Persona across various downstream tasks.

comprises three hidden layers, a discontinuity-capturing layer, a categorical

a piecewise smooth function, even with a large number of pieces, can be
approximated by a single neural network with high prediction accuracy. We then
leverage the proposed network model to solve anisotropic elliptic interface
problems. The network is trained by minimizing the mean squared error loss of
the system. Our results show that, despite its simple and shallow structure,
the proposed neural network model exhibits comparable efficiency and accuracy
to traditional grid-based numerical methods.

  for enhanced non-classical light emission",,,,,physics.optics cond-mat.other,http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/,"  This work presents a foundational approach for fabricating arrays of
self-aligned micro- and nanopillar structures incorporating individual
site-controlled quantum dots (QDs) for enhanced light extraction. This method
leverages the non-planar surface morphology of pyramidal QD samples to define
dielectric masks self - aligned to the QD positions. The mask size, and
consequently the lateral dimensions of the pillars, is precisely controlled
through a chemical mechanical polishing step, obviating the need for any
additional lithography step for creating the pillar. This fabrication technique
offers several key advantages, including precise control over the pillar sites,
and fully deterministic embedding of QD structures. The functionality of the
structures was validated by integrating single In0.25Ga0.75As QDs - upon
two-photon excitation of the biexciton state, the emission of single and
polarization-entangled photon pairs was observed. Additionally, an extra
fabrication step to deposit dome-like structures atop the pillars was
demonstrated, effectively enhancing light extraction efficiency up to 12%.

ecosystem conservation but generates vast unsupervised audio data, posing
challenges for extracting meaningful information. Deep Learning techniques
offer a promising solution. BirdNET, a widely used model for bird
identification, has shown success in many study systems but is limited in some
regions due to biases in its training data. A key challenge in bird species
detection is that many recordings either lack target species or contain
overlapping vocalizations. To overcome these problems, we developed a
multi-stage pipeline for automatic bird vocalization identification in Do\~nana
National Park (SW Spain), a region facing significant conservation threats. Our
approach included a Bird Song Detector to isolate vocalizations and custom
classifiers trained with BirdNET embeddings. We manually annotated 461 minutes
of audio from three habitats across nine locations, yielding 3,749 annotations
for 34 classes. Spectrograms facilitated the use of image processing
techniques. Applying the Bird Song Detector before classification improved
species identification, as all classification models performed better when
analyzing only the segments where birds were detected. Specifically, the
combination of the Bird Song Detector and fine-tuned BirdNET compared to the
baseline without the Bird Song Detector. Our approach demonstrated the
effectiveness of integrating a Bird Song Detector with fine-tuned
classification models for bird identification at local soundscapes. These
findings highlight the need to adapt general-purpose tools for specific
ecological challenges, as demonstrated in Do\~nana. Automatically detecting
bird species serves for tracking the health status of this threatened
ecosystem, given the sensitivity of birds to environmental changes, and helps
in the design of conservation measures for reducing biodiversity loss

  Generation",,,,,cs.CV cs.AI,http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/,"  Traditional transformer-based semantic segmentation relies on quantized
embeddings. However, our analysis reveals that autoencoder accuracy on
segmentation mask using quantized embeddings (e.g. VQ-VAE) is 8% lower than
continuous-valued embeddings (e.g. KL-VAE). Motivated by this, we propose a
continuous-valued embedding framework for semantic segmentation. By
reformulating semantic mask generation as a continuous image-to-embedding
diffusion process, our approach eliminates the need for discrete latent
representations while preserving fine-grained spatial and semantic details. Our
key contribution includes a diffusion-guided autoregressive transformer that
learns a continuous semantic embedding space by modeling long-range
dependencies in image features. Our framework contains a unified architecture
combining a VAE encoder for continuous feature extraction, a diffusion-guided
transformer for conditioned embedding generation, and a VAE decoder for
semantic mask reconstruction. Our setting facilitates zero-shot domain
adaptation capabilities enabled by the continuity of the embedding space.
Experiments across diverse datasets (e.g., Cityscapes and domain-shifted
variants) demonstrate state-of-the-art robustness to distribution shifts,
including adverse weather (e.g., fog, snow) and viewpoint variations. Our model
also exhibits strong noise resilience, achieving robust performance ($\approx$
95% AP compared to baseline) under gaussian noise, moderate motion blur, and
moderate brightness/contrast variations, while experiencing only a moderate
impact ($\approx$ 90% AP compared to baseline) from 50% salt and pepper noise,
saturation and hue shifts. Code available:

CLIP, has expanded 2D segmentation capabilities beyond fixed classes predefined
by the dataset, enabling zero-shot understanding across diverse scenes.
Extending these capabilities to 3D segmentation introduces challenges, as
CLIP's image-based embeddings often lack the geometric detail necessary for 3D
scene segmentation. Recent methods tend to address this by introducing
additional segmentation models or replacing CLIP with variations trained on
segmentation data, which lead to redundancy or loss on CLIP's general language
capabilities. To overcome this limitation, we introduce SPNeRF, a NeRF based
zero-shot 3D segmentation approach that leverages geometric priors. We
integrate geometric primitives derived from the 3D scene into NeRF training to
produce primitive-wise CLIP features, avoiding the ambiguity of point-wise
features. Additionally, we propose a primitive-based merging mechanism enhanced
with affinity scores. Without relying on additional segmentation models, our

  Yunhe Wang",Mixture of Lookup Experts,,,,,cs.LG cs.CL,http://creativecommons.org/publicdomain/zero/1.0/,"  Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) activates only a subset of experts during inference,
allowing the model to maintain low inference FLOPs and latency even as the
parameter count scales up. However, since MoE dynamically selects the experts,
all the experts need to be loaded into VRAM. Their large parameter size still
limits deployment, and offloading, which load experts into VRAM only when
needed, significantly increase inference latency. To address this, we propose
Mixture of Lookup Experts (MoLE), a new MoE architecture that is efficient in
both communication and VRAM usage. In MoLE, the experts are Feed-Forward
Networks (FFNs) during training, taking the output of the embedding layer as
input. Before inference, these experts can be re-parameterized as lookup tables
(LUTs) that retrieves expert outputs based on input ids, and offloaded to
storage devices. Therefore, we do not need to perform expert computations
during inference. Instead, we directly retrieve the expert's computation
results based on input ids and load them into VRAM, and thus the resulting
communication overhead is negligible. Experiments show that, with the same
FLOPs and VRAM usage, MoLE achieves inference speeds comparable to dense models
and significantly faster than MoE with experts offloading, while maintaining
performance on par with MoE.

with dependencies (MSPD), which is a unifying writing for a large class of
processes: counting, loss, intensity, and also shifted processes. The framework
takes into account dynamic dependencies between the frequency and the severity
components of the risk, and therefore induces theoretical challenges in the
computations of risk valuations. We present a general method for calculating
different quantities related to these MSPDs, which combines the Poisson
imbedding, the pseudo-chaotic expansion and Malliavin calculus. The methodology
is illustrated for the computation of explicit general correlation formula.

leveraging cross-modal embeddings for fast, high-quality stylization. However,
most existing pipelines assume a \emph{single} textual style prompt, limiting
the range of artistic control and expressiveness. In this paper, we propose a
novel \emph{multi-prompt style interpolation} framework that extends the
recently introduced \textbf{StyleMamba} approach. Our method supports blending
or interpolating among multiple textual prompts (eg, ``cubism,''
``impressionism,'' and ``cartoon''), allowing the creation of nuanced or hybrid
artistic styles within a \emph{single} image. We introduce a
\textit{Multi-Prompt Embedding Mixer} combined with \textit{Adaptive Blending
Weights} to enable fine-grained control over the spatial and semantic influence
of each style. Further, we propose a \emph{Hierarchical Masked Directional
Loss} to refine region-specific style consistency. Experiments and user studies
confirm our approach outperforms single-prompt baselines and naive linear
combinations of styles, achieving superior style fidelity, text-image
alignment, and artistic flexibility, all while maintaining the computational
efficiency offered by the state-space formulation.

  RoPE-Based MMDiT for Versatile Image Editing",Project page: https://wtybest.github.io/projects/FreeFlux/,,,,cs.CV,http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/,"  The integration of Rotary Position Embedding (RoPE) in Multimodal Diffusion
Transformer (MMDiT) has significantly enhanced text-to-image generation
quality. However, the fundamental reliance of self-attention layers on
positional embedding versus query-key similarity during generation remains an
intriguing question. We present the first mechanistic analysis of RoPE-based
MMDiT models (e.g., FLUX), introducing an automated probing strategy that
disentangles positional information versus content dependencies by
strategically manipulating RoPE during generation. Our analysis reveals
distinct dependency patterns that do not straightforwardly correlate with
depth, offering new insights into the layer-specific roles in RoPE-based MMDiT.
Based on these findings, we propose a training-free, task-specific image
editing framework that categorizes editing tasks into three types:
position-dependent editing (e.g., object addition), content
similarity-dependent editing (e.g., non-rigid editing), and region-preserved
editing (e.g., background replacement). For each type, we design tailored
key-value injection strategies based on the characteristics of the editing
task. Extensive qualitative and quantitative evaluations demonstrate that our
method outperforms state-of-the-art approaches, particularly in preserving
original semantic content and achieving seamless modifications.

several real-world logistics scenarios that pose significant challenges for
optimization. Neural Combinatorial Optimization (NCO) has emerged as a
promising alternative to classical approaches, as it can learn fast heuristics
to solve VRPs. However, most research works in NCO for VRPs focus on simplified
settings, which do not account for asymmetric distances and travel durations
that cannot be derived by simple Euclidean distances and unrealistic data
distributions, hindering real-world deployment. This work introduces RRNCO
(Real Routing NCO) to bridge the gap of NCO between synthetic and real-world
VRPs in the critical aspects of both data and modeling. First, we introduce a
new, openly available dataset with real-world data containing a diverse dataset
of locations, distances, and duration matrices from 100 cities, considering
realistic settings with actual routing distances and durations obtained from
Open Source Routing Machine (OSRM). Second, we propose a novel approach that
efficiently processes both node and edge features through contextual gating,
enabling the construction of more informed node embedding, and we finally
incorporate an Adaptation Attention Free Module (AAFM) with neural adaptive
bias mechanisms that effectively integrates not only distance matrices but also
angular relationships between nodes, allowing our model to capture rich
structural information. RRNCO achieves state-of-the-art results in real-world
VRPs among NCO methods. We make our dataset and code publicly available at
https://github.com/ai4co/real-routing-nco.
