2310.17178,Leonid Ugadiarov,"Leonid Ugadiarov, Vitaliy Vorobyov, Aleksandr I. Panov",Relational Object-Centric Actor-Critic,,,,,cs.AI cs.LG cs.RO,http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/,"  The advances in unsupervised object-centric representation learning have
significantly improved its application to downstream tasks. Recent works
highlight that disentangled object representations can aid policy learning in
image-based, object-centric reinforcement learning tasks. This paper proposes a
novel object-centric reinforcement learning algorithm that integrates
actor-critic and model-based approaches by incorporating an object-centric
world model within the critic. The world model captures the environment's
data-generating process by predicting the next state and reward given the
current state-action pair, where actions are interventions in the environment.
In model-based reinforcement learning, world model learning can be interpreted
as a causal induction problem, where the agent must learn the causal
relationships underlying the environment's dynamics. We evaluate our method in
a simulated 3D robotic environment and a 2D environment with compositional
structure. As baselines, we compare against object-centric, model-free
actor-critic algorithms and a state-of-the-art monolithic model-based
algorithm. While the baselines show comparable performance in easier tasks, our
approach outperforms them in more challenging scenarios with a large number of
objects or more complex dynamics.

  Applications to DNA and Protein Design",ICLR 2025,,,,cs.LG cs.AI,http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/,"  Recent studies have demonstrated the strong empirical performance of
diffusion models on discrete sequences across domains from natural language to
biological sequence generation. For example, in the protein inverse folding
task, conditional diffusion models have achieved impressive results in
generating natural-like sequences that fold back into the original structure.
However, practical design tasks often require not only modeling a conditional
distribution but also optimizing specific task objectives. For instance, we may
prefer protein sequences with high stability. To address this, we consider the
scenario where we have pre-trained discrete diffusion models that can generate
natural-like sequences, as well as reward models that map sequences to task
objectives. We then formulate the reward maximization problem within discrete
diffusion models, analogous to reinforcement learning (RL), while minimizing
the KL divergence against pretrained diffusion models to preserve naturalness.
To solve this RL problem, we propose a novel algorithm, DRAKES, that enables
direct backpropagation of rewards through entire trajectories generated by
diffusion models, by making the originally non-differentiable trajectories
differentiable using the Gumbel-Softmax trick. Our theoretical analysis
indicates that our approach can generate sequences that are both natural-like
and yield high rewards. While similar tasks have been recently explored in
diffusion models for continuous domains, our work addresses unique algorithmic
and theoretical challenges specific to discrete diffusion models, which arise
from their foundation in continuous-time Markov chains rather than Brownian
motion. Finally, we demonstrate the effectiveness of DRAKES in generating DNA
and protein sequences that optimize enhancer activity and protein stability,
respectively, important tasks for gene therapies and protein-based
therapeutics.

  Limited Resources",Accepted to ICLR 2025 as a Poster,,,,cs.LG stat.ML,http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/,"  Machine learning is increasingly used to select which individuals receive
limited-resource interventions in domains such as human services, education,
development, and more. However, it is often not apparent what the right
quantity is for models to predict. Policymakers rarely have access to data from
a randomized controlled trial (RCT) that would enable accurate estimates of
which individuals would benefit more from the intervention, while observational
data creates a substantial risk of bias in treatment effect estimates.
Practitioners instead commonly use a technique termed ``risk-based targeting""
where the model is just used to predict each individual's status quo outcome
(an easier, non-causal task). Those with higher predicted risk are offered
treatment. There is currently almost no empirical evidence to inform which
choices lead to the most effective machine learning-informed targeting
strategies in social domains. In this work, we use data from 5 real-world RCTs
in a variety of domains to empirically assess such choices. We find that when
treatment effects can be estimated with high accuracy (which we simulate by
allowing the model to partially observe outcomes in advance), treatment effect
based targeting substantially outperforms risk-based targeting, even when
treatment effect estimates are biased. Moreover, these results hold even when
the policymaker has strong normative preferences for assisting higher-risk
individuals. However, the features and data actually available in most RCTs we
examine do not suffice for accurate estimates of heterogeneous treatment
effects. Our results suggest treatment effect targeting has significant
potential benefits, but realizing these benefits requires improvements to data
collection and model training beyond what is currently common in practice.

  Pangu-Weather architecture and IMDAA reanalysis Data",,,,,physics.ao-ph,http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/,"  Numerical Weather Prediction (NWP) has advanced significantly in recent
decades but still faces challenges in accuracy, computational efficiency, and
scalability. Data-driven weather models have shown great promise, sometimes
surpassing operational NWP systems. However, training these models on massive
datasets incurs high computational costs. A regional data-driven approach
offers a cost-effective alternative for localized forecasts. This study
develops a regional weather forecasting model for India by efficiently
modifying the Pangu-Weather (PW) architecture. The model is trained using the
Indian Monsoon Data Assimilation and Analysis (IMDAA) reanalysis dataset with
limited computational resources. Prediction results are evaluated using Root
Mean Square Error (RMSE), Anomaly Correlation Coefficient (ACC), Mean Absolute
Percentage Error (MAPE), and Fractional Skill Score (FSS). At a 6-hour lead
time, MAPE remains below 5%, FSS exceeds 0.86, and ACC stays above 0.94,
demonstrating robustness. Three forecasting approaches, static, autoregressive,
and hierarchical, are compared. Errors increase with lead time in all cases.
The static approach exhibits periodic fluctuations in error metrics, which are
absent in the autoregressive method. The hierarchical approach also shows
fluctuations, though with reduced intensity after three days. Among these, the
hierarchical approach performs best while maintaining computational efficiency.
Furthermore, the model effectively predicts cyclone tracks using the
hierarchical approach, achieving results comparable to observational and
reanalysis datasets.

  Perceptual Feedback","14 pages, 9 figures",,,,cs.LG,http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/4.0/,"  Alignment between human brain networks and artificial models is actively
studied in machine learning and neuroscience. A widely adopted approach to
explore their functional alignment is to identify metamers for both humans and
models. Metamers refer to input stimuli that are physically different but
equivalent within a given system. If a model's metameric space completely
matched the human metameric space, the model would achieve functional alignment
with humans. However, conventional methods lack direct ways to search for human
metamers. Instead, researchers first develop biologically inspired models and
then infer about human metamers indirectly by testing whether model metamers
also appear as metamers to humans. Here, we propose the Multidimensional
Adaptive Metamer Exploration (MAME) framework, enabling direct high-dimensional
exploration of human metameric space. MAME leverages online image generation
guided by human perceptual feedback. Specifically, it modulates reference
images across multiple dimensions by leveraging hierarchical responses from
convolutional neural networks (CNNs). Generated images are presented to
participants whose perceptual discriminability is assessed in a behavioral
task. Based on participants' responses, subsequent image generation parameters
are adaptively updated online. Using our MAME framework, we successfully
measured a human metameric space of over fifty dimensions within a single
experiment. Experimental results showed that human discrimination sensitivity
was lower for metameric images based on low-level features compared to
high-level features, which image contrast metrics could not explain. The
finding suggests that the model computes low-level information not essential
for human perception. Our framework has the potential to contribute to
developing interpretable AI and understanding of brain function in
neuroscience.

  Patching for Heterogeneous UAV Swarms",,,,,cs.SE,http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/,"  Heterogeneous unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) swarms consist of dozens to
hundreds of drones with different roles and varying hardware and software
requirements collaborating towards a shared mission. While traditional
approaches for synchronized software updates assume swarms to be unstructured
and homogeneous, the heterogeneous nature of modern swarms and the emerging
need of drones to update their deep learning (perception) models with new
objectives or data as a mission unfolds, has made efficient software update
methods crucial for swarms to adapt to dynamic environments. To address these
challenges, we introduce the SwarmUpdate framework for software updates in
heterogeneous UAV swarms, composed of two key components: SwarmSync and
SwarmModelPatch. SwarmSync is a hierarchical software update synchronization
strategy to distribute a software update to the right subset of drones within a
swarm, while SwarmModelPatch is a deep learning model patching method that
reduces the size of a (deep learning model) update by only allowing some layers
of the model to be updated (freezing the other layers). In this paper, we
systematically evaluate the performance of SwarmSync through large-scale
simulations in the ARGoS swarm simulator, comparing SwarmSync to auction-based
(SOUL) and gossip-based rebroadcasting (Gossip) baselines, and SwarmModelPatch
to a non-incremental model patching strategy.

  Optical Fiber Sensing with Differential State of Health Metrics",,,,,physics.app-ph,http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/,"  The reliability and safety of Lithium-ion batteries (LiBs) are of great
concern in the energy storage industry. Nevertheless, the real-time monitoring
of their degradation remains challenging due to limited quantitative metrics
available during cycling. This study addresses this limitation by employing a
novel approach that combines external optical fiber sensing with advanced data
analysis techniques to comprehensively assess battery health. We engineered a
non-invasive optical sensing platform using tandem pairs of polymeric and
silica-based fiber Bragg grating (FBG) sensors affixed to the external surface
of commercial Li-ion button cells, enabling simultaneous, real-time monitoring
of device-level volume changes and thermal events over 600 cycles. Our analysis
incorporated differential techniques to estimate the battery's state of health
(SOH) based on capacity, strain, and temperature variations with respect to
voltage. Additionally, we implemented and compared three deep learning models -
Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM), Gated Recurrent Unit (GRU), and Artificial
Neural Network (ANN) - to predict battery SOH over cycles. We were able to
capture both continuous and spontaneous degradation events and provide unique
insights into battery behavior across its lifecycle through differential
analysis and new SOH metrics demonstrating high correlation with conventional
measures. This multi-parameter approach, combining advanced sensing techniques
with innovative data analysis and deep learning methods, contributes
significantly to battery diagnostics, potentially improving reliability
assessment, enhancing safety standards, and accelerating the development of
more sustainable energy storage solutions.

performance remains unclear. To quantify the capabilities of AI systems in
terms of human capabilities, we propose a new metric: 50%-task-completion time
horizon. This is the time humans typically take to complete tasks that AI
models can complete with 50% success rate. We first timed humans with relevant
domain expertise on a combination of RE-Bench, HCAST, and 66 novel shorter
tasks. On these tasks, current frontier AI models such as Claude 3.7 Sonnet
have a 50% time horizon of around 50 minutes. Furthermore, frontier AI time
horizon has been doubling approximately every seven months since 2019, though
the trend may have accelerated in 2024. The increase in AI models' time
horizons seems to be primarily driven by greater reliability and ability to
adapt to mistakes, combined with better logical reasoning and tool use
capabilities. We discuss the limitations of our results -- including their
degree of external validity -- and the implications of increased autonomy for
dangerous capabilities. If these results generalize to real-world software
tasks, extrapolation of this trend predicts that within 5 years, AI systems
will be capable of automating many software tasks that currently take humans a
month.

objective function of the primal SVM formulation, replacing the traditional
slack variable. Furthermore, each misclassified sample is assigned a priority
and an associated constraint. The resulting formulation is a mixed-integer
programming model, efficiently solved using Benders decomposition. The proposed
model's performance was benchmarked against existing models, including Soft
Margin SVM, weighted SVM, and NuSVC. Two primary hypotheses were examined: 1)
The proposed model improves the F1-score for the minority class in imbalanced
classification tasks. 2) The proposed model enhances classification accuracy in
noisy datasets. These hypotheses were evaluated using a Wilcoxon test across

consistency across measurements/bias conditions and the non-consideration of
imperfect electron extraction at the collecting contact and its corresponding
effect on the recombination rate in the bulk. We applied the model to analyse
the time constants obtained from intensity-modulated photocurrent (IMPS) and
photovoltage (IMVS) measurements of a hematite photoanode, obtaining an
electron extraction velocity of 100 cm/s close to the 1 sun open-circuit

model further predicts a linear dependence of the photocurrent versus anodic
voltage, an observation whose origin has been strongly debated in the

allows its extension to other photoanodes and photovoltaic systems, by the
addition or removal of specific physical mechanisms.

automatically construct the Azimuthal RHEED from bare RHEED images, requiring
no further measurement equipment. We use two artificial neural networks: an
image segmentation model to track the center of the specular spot and a
regression model to determine the orientation of the crystal with respect to
the incident electron beam of the RHEED system. Our technique enables accurate

depends on the quality of the reward model. While this quality is primarily
evaluated through accuracy, it remains unclear whether accuracy fully captures
what makes a reward model an effective teacher. We address this question from
an optimization perspective. First, we prove that regardless of how accurate a
reward model is, if it induces low reward variance, then the RLHF objective
suffers from a flat landscape. Consequently, even a perfectly accurate reward
model can lead to extremely slow optimization, underperforming less accurate
models that induce higher reward variance. We additionally show that a reward
model that works well for one language model can induce low reward variance,
and thus a flat objective landscape, for another. These results establish a
fundamental limitation of evaluating reward models solely based on accuracy or
independently of the language model they guide. Experiments using models of up
to 8B parameters corroborate our theory, demonstrating the interplay between
reward variance, accuracy, and reward maximization rate. Overall, our findings
highlight that beyond accuracy, a reward model needs to induce sufficient
variance for efficient optimization.

accurate prediction of clinical outcomes-encompassing both tumor control and
adverse events (AEs). This review critically evaluates the evolution of
data-driven approaches in predicting patient outcomes in head and neck cancer
patients treated with radiation therapy, from traditional dose-volume
constraints to cutting-edge artificial intelligence (AI) and causal inference
framework. The integration of linear energy transfer in patient outcomes study,
which has uncovered critical mechanisms behind unexpected toxicity, was also
introduced for proton therapy. Three transformative methodological advances are
reviewed: radiomics, AI-based algorithms, and causal inference frameworks.
While radiomics has enabled quantitative characterization of medical images, AI
models have demonstrated superior capability than traditional models. However,
the field faces significant challenges in translating statistical correlations
from real-world data into interventional clinical insights. We highlight that
how causal inference methods can bridge this gap by providing a rigorous
framework for identifying treatment effects. Looking ahead, we envision that
combining these complementary approaches, especially the interventional
prediction models, will enable more personalized treatment strategies,
ultimately improving both tumor control and quality of life for head and neck
cancer patients treated with radiation therapy.

  Haas","Efficient Service Differentiation and Energy Management in Hybrid
  WiFi/LiFi Networks","28 pages, 9 figures",,,,math.OC,http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/,"  In this paper, we propose an innovative predict-and-optimize algorithm
designed for hybrid WiFi/LiFi networks, aiming to achieve service
differentiation while maximizing energy efficiency (EE). The proposed framework
utilizes multi-access technology real-time intelligent controller (mATRIC) to
dynamically predict the appropriate network slice for each user based on
historically monitored key performance indicators (KPIs). This prediction is
facilitated by a deep learning model trained using the resilient
backpropagation algorithm, with training conducted on KPIs data at the
universal non-real time RAN intelligent controller (non-RT RIC). This trained
model enables real-time slice selection by mATRIC. In the subsequent phase, the
algorithm focuses on optimizing EE of hybrid network as a function of precoding
vectors for the predicted slices by employing techniques from sequential convex
approximation and the inner approximation method. We introduce novel
approximations to convert non-convex objective functions and constraints into
convex forms, and develop an iterative algorithm to achieve sub-optimal
solutions. Additionally, the EE maximization problem, ensures alignment with
end-to-end latency requirements. It also addresses the various constraints
inherent to hybrid systems, such as input signal limitations for LiFi LEDs,
data rate restrictions, and power budget considerations. Simulation results
validate the effectiveness of the proposed algorithm, demonstrating significant
improvements in EE while ensuring service differentiation within hybrid network
environments.
