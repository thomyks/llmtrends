  from Lightweight Neural Networks",,,,,cs.CV,http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/,"  This paper proposes SenseExpo, an efficient autonomous exploration framework
based on a lightweight prediction network, which addresses the limitations of
traditional methods in computational overhead and environmental generalization.
By integrating Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs), Transformer, and Fast
Fourier Convolution (FFC), we designed a lightweight prediction model with
merely 709k parameters. Our smallest model achieves better performance on the
KTH dataset than U-net (24.5M) and LaMa (51M), delivering PSNR 9.026 and SSIM
0.718, particularly representing a 38.7% PSNR improvement over the
51M-parameter LaMa model. Cross-domain testing demonstrates its strong
generalization capability, with an FID score of 161.55 on the HouseExpo
dataset, significantly outperforming comparable methods. Regarding exploration
efficiency, on the KTH dataset,SenseExpo demonstrates approximately a 67.9%
time reduction in exploration time compared to MapEx. On the MRPB 1.0 dataset,
SenseExpo achieves 77.1% time reduction roughly compared to MapEx. Deployed as
a plug-and-play ROS node, the framework seamlessly integrates with existing
navigation systems, providing an efficient solution for resource-constrained
devices.
