2503.15947,Tianyi Hu,"Tianyi Hu, Qingxu Fu, Zhiqiang Pu, Yuan Wang, Tenghai Qiu","Unreal-MAP: Unreal-Engine-Based General Platform for Multi-Agent
  Reinforcement Learning",,,,,cs.AI,http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/,"  In this paper, we propose Unreal Multi-Agent Playground (Unreal-MAP), an MARL
general platform based on the Unreal-Engine (UE). Unreal-MAP allows users to
freely create multi-agent tasks using the vast visual and physical resources
available in the UE community, and deploy state-of-the-art (SOTA) MARL
algorithms within them. Unreal-MAP is user-friendly in terms of deployment,
modification, and visualization, and all its components are open-source. We
also develop an experimental framework compatible with algorithms ranging from
rule-based to learning-based provided by third-party frameworks. Lastly, we
deploy several SOTA algorithms in example tasks developed via Unreal-MAP, and
conduct corresponding experimental analyses. We believe Unreal-MAP can play an
important role in the MARL field by closely integrating existing algorithms
with user-customized tasks, thus advancing the field of MARL.
