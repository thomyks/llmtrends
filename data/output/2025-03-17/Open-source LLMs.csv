  Mittal","Dressing the Imagination: A Dataset for AI-Powered Translation of Text
  into Fashion Outfits and A Novel KAN Adapter for Enhanced Feature Adaptation",Under review at a conference,,,,cs.CV,http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-nd/4.0/,"  Specialized datasets that capture the fashion industry's rich language and
styling elements can boost progress in AI-driven fashion design. We present
FLORA (Fashion Language Outfit Representation for Apparel Generation), the
first comprehensive dataset containing 4,330 curated pairs of fashion outfits
and corresponding textual descriptions. Each description utilizes
industry-specific terminology and jargon commonly used by professional fashion
designers, providing precise and detailed insights into the outfits. Hence, the
dataset captures the delicate features and subtle stylistic elements necessary
to create high-fidelity fashion designs. We demonstrate that fine-tuning
generative models on the FLORA dataset significantly enhances their capability
to generate accurate and stylistically rich images from textual descriptions of
fashion sketches. FLORA will catalyze the creation of advanced AI models
capable of comprehending and producing subtle, stylistically rich fashion
designs. It will also help fashion designers and end-users to bring their ideas
to life.
  As a second orthogonal contribution, we introduce KAN Adapters, which
leverage Kolmogorov-Arnold Networks (KAN) as adaptive modules. They serve as
replacements for traditional MLP-based LoRA adapters. With learnable
spline-based activations, KAN Adapters excel in modeling complex, non-linear
relationships, achieving superior fidelity, faster convergence and semantic
alignment. Extensive experiments and ablation studies on our proposed FLORA
dataset validate the superiority of KAN Adapters over LoRA adapters. To foster
further research and collaboration, we will open-source both the FLORA and our
implementation code.
