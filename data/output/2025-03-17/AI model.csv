  Existence of Optimal Policies and Discrete-Time Approximations",27,,,,math.OC,http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/,"  We present existence and discrete-time approximation results on optimal
control policies for continuous-time stochastic control problems under a
variety of information structures. These include fully observed models,
partially observed models and multi-agent models with decentralized information
structures. While there exist comprehensive existence and approximations
results for the fully observed setup in the literature, few prior research
exists on discrete-time approximation results for partially observed models.
For decentralized models, even existence results have not received much
attention except for specialized models and approximation has been an open
problem. Our existence and approximations results lead to the applicability of
well-established partially observed Markov decision processes and the
relatively more mature theory of discrete-time decentralized stochastic control
to be applicable for computing near optimal solutions for continuous-time
stochastic control.

  Multi-Environment Matrix Sensing",,,,,cs.LG math.OC,http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/,"  Models are expected to engage in invariance learning, which involves
distinguishing the core relations that remain consistent across varying
environments to ensure the predictions are safe, robust and fair. While
existing works consider specific algorithms to realize invariance learning, we
show that model has the potential to learn invariance through standard training
procedures. In other words, this paper studies the implicit bias of Stochastic
Gradient Descent (SGD) over heterogeneous data and shows that the implicit bias
drives the model learning towards an invariant solution. We call the phenomenon
the implicit invariance learning. Specifically, we theoretically investigate
the multi-environment low-rank matrix sensing problem where in each
environment, the signal comprises (i) a lower-rank invariant part shared across
all environments; and (ii) a significantly varying environment-dependent
spurious component. The key insight is, through simply employing the large step
size large-batch SGD sequentially in each environment without any explicit
regularization, the oscillation caused by heterogeneity can provably prevent
model learning spurious signals. The model reaches the invariant solution after
certain iterations. In contrast, model learned using pooled SGD over all data
would simultaneously learn both the invariant and spurious signals. Overall, we
unveil another implicit bias that is a result of the symbiosis between the
heterogeneity of data and modern algorithms, which is, to the best of our
knowledge, first in the literature.

  supplemented with citywide synthetic data",,,,,econ.EM,http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/4.0/,"  As an IT-enabled multi-passenger mobility service, microtransit can improve
accessibility, reduce congestion, and enhance flexibility. However, its
heterogeneous impacts across travelers necessitate better tools for
microtransit forecasting and revenue management, especially when actual usage
data are limited. We propose a nested nonparametric model for joint travel mode
and ride pass subscription choice, estimated using marginal subscription data
and synthetic populations. The model improves microtransit choice modeling by
(1) leveraging citywide synthetic data for greater spatiotemporal granularity,
(2) employing an agent-based estimation approach to capture heterogeneous user
preferences, and (3) integrating mode choice parameters into subscription
choice modeling. We apply our methodology to a case study in Arlington, TX,
using synthetic data from Replica Inc. and microtransit data from Via. Our
model accurately predicts the number of subscribers in the upper branch and
achieves a high McFadden R2 in the lower branch (0.603 for weekday trips and
0.576 for weekend trips), while also retrieving interpretable elasticities and
consumer surplus. We further integrate the model into a simulation-based
framework for microtransit revenue management. For the ride pass pricing
policy, our simulation results show that reducing the price of the weekly pass
($25 -> $18.9) and monthly pass ($80 -> $71.5) would surprisingly increase
total revenue by $127 per day. For the subsidy policy, our simulation results
show that a 100% fare discount would reduce 61 car trips to AT&T Stadium for a
game event, and increase 82 microtransit trips to Medical City Arlington, but
require subsidies of $533 per event and $483 per day, respectively.

serve as valuable probes for investigating the distant Universe. However, this
necessitates an increase in the number of GRBs with determined redshifts, as
currently, only 12% of GRBs have known redshifts due to observational biases.
Aims. We aim to address the shortage of GRBs with measured redshifts, enabling
us to fully realize their potential as valuable cosmological probes Methods.
Following Dainotti et al. (2024c), we have taken a second step to overcome this
issue by adding 30 more GRBs to our ensemble supervised machine learning
training sample, an increase of 20%, which will help us obtain better redshift
estimates. In addition, we have built a freely accessible and user-friendly web
app that infers the redshift of long GRBs (LGRBs) with plateau emission using
our machine learning model. The web app is the first of its kind for such a
study and will allow the community to obtain redshift estimates by entering the
GRB parameters in the app. Results. Through our machine learning model, we have
successfully estimated redshifts for 276 LGRBs using X-ray afterglow parameters
detected by the Neil Gehrels Swift Observatory and increased the sample of
LGRBs with known redshifts by 110%. We also perform Monte Carlo simulations to
demonstrate the future applicability of this research. Conclusions. The results
presented in this research will enable the community to increase the sample of
GRBs with known redshift estimates. This can help address many outstanding
issues, such as GRB formation rate, luminosity function, and the true nature of
low-luminosity GRBs, and enable the application of GRBs as standard candles

named it Social Architecture of Capitalism that has been introduced by Ian
Wright. The model contemplates two main types of agents, workers and
capitalists, which can also be unemployed. Starting from a state where all
agents are unemployed and possess the same initial wealth, the system, governed
by a few simple rules, quickly self-organizes into two classes. After a
transient, the model reproduces the statistics of many relevant macroeconomic
quantities of real economies worldwide, notably the two regimes of the
distributions of wealth and income. We perform extensive simulations testing
the role of the model parameters (number of agents, total wealth, and salary
range) on the resulting distribution of wealth and income, the social
distribution of agents, and other stylized facts of the dynamics. Our main
finding is that, according to the model, in an economy where total wealth is
conserved and with a fixed average wage, the increase in wealth per capita
comes with more inequality.

  page:https://github.com/xyshao23/Awesome-Generative-Models-for-Decision-Making-Taxonomy",,,,cs.LG cs.AI,http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/,"  In recent years, the exceptional performance of generative models in
generative tasks has sparked significant interest in their integration into
decision-making processes. Due to their ability to handle complex data
distributions and their strong model capacity, generative models can be
effectively incorporated into decision-making systems by generating
trajectories that guide agents toward high-reward state-action regions or
intermediate sub-goals. This paper presents a comprehensive review of the
application of generative models in decision-making tasks. We classify seven
fundamental types of generative models: energy-based models, generative
adversarial networks, variational autoencoders, normalizing flows, diffusion
models, generative flow networks, and autoregressive models. Regarding their
applications, we categorize their functions into three main roles: controllers,
modelers and optimizers, and discuss how each role contributes to
decision-making. Furthermore, we examine the deployment of these models across
five critical real-world decision-making scenarios. Finally, we summarize the
strengths and limitations of current approaches and propose three key
directions for advancing next-generation generative directive models:
high-performance algorithms, large-scale generalized decision-making models,
and self-evolving and adaptive models.

profitable threat to decentralized finance (DeFi), posing a large-scale,
persistent, and growing risk to the ecosystem. Unlike traditional scams such as
rug pulls or honeypots (USENIX Sec'19, USENIX Sec'23), SLID gradually siphons
funds from liquidity pools over extended periods, making detection
significantly more challenging. In this paper, we conducted the first
large-scale empirical analysis of 319,166 liquidity pools across six major
decentralized exchanges (DEXs) since 2018. We identified 3,117 SLID affected
liquidity pools, resulting in cumulative losses of more than US$103 million. We
propose a rule-based heuristic and an enhanced machine learning model for early
detection. Our machine learning model achieves a detection speed 4.77 times
faster than the heuristic while maintaining 95% accuracy. Our study establishes
a foundation for protecting DeFi investors at an early stage and promoting
transparency in the DeFi ecosystem.

structure characterization. Despite their widespread application, analyzing
pXRD diffractograms still presents a significant challenge to automation and a
bottleneck in high-throughput discovery in self-driving labs. Machine learning
promises to resolve this bottleneck by enabling automated powder diffraction
analysis. A notable difficulty in applying machine learning to this domain is
the lack of sufficiently sized experimental datasets, which has constrained
researchers to train primarily on simulated data. However, models trained on
simulated pXRD patterns showed limited generalization to experimental patterns,
particularly for low-quality experimental patterns with high noise levels and
elevated backgrounds. With the Open Experimental Powder X-Ray Diffraction
Database (opXRD), we provide an openly available and easily accessible dataset
of labeled and unlabeled experimental powder diffractograms. Labeled opXRD data
can be used to evaluate the performance of models on experimental data and
unlabeled opXRD data can help improve the performance of models on experimental
data, e.g. through transfer learning methods. We collected 92552
diffractograms, 2179 of them labeled, from a wide spectrum of materials
classes. We hope this ongoing effort can guide machine learning research toward
fully automated analysis of pXRD data and thus enable future self-driving
materials labs.
