striking features. In particular, the decrease rate of empirical risk is
non-monotone even after averaging over large batches. Long plateaus in which
one observes barely any progress alternate with intervals of rapid decrease.
These successive phases of learning often take place on very different time
scales. Finally, models learnt in an early phase are typically `simpler' or
`easier to learn' although in a way that is difficult to formalize.
  Although theoretical explanations of these phenomena have been put forward,
each of them captures at best certain specific regimes. In this paper, we study
the gradient flow dynamics of a wide two-layer neural network in
high-dimension, when data are distributed according to a single-index model
(i.e., the target function depends on a one-dimensional projection of the
covariates). Based on a mixture of new rigorous results, non-rigorous
mathematical derivations, and numerical simulations, we propose a scenario for
the learning dynamics in this setting. In particular, the proposed evolution
exhibits separation of timescales and intermittency. These behaviors arise
naturally because the population gradient flow can be recast as a singularly
perturbed dynamical system.

scarce labeled data alongside abundant unlabeled data. Despite significant
progress, prevailing SSL methods predominantly enforce consistency between
different augmented views of individual samples, thereby overlooking the rich
relational structure inherent within a mini-batch. In this paper, we present
RelationMatch, a novel SSL framework that explicitly enforces in-batch
relational consistency through a Matrix Cross-Entropy (MCE) loss function. The
proposed MCE loss is rigorously derived from both matrix analysis and
information geometry perspectives, ensuring theoretical soundness and practical
efficacy. Extensive empirical evaluations on standard benchmarks, including a
notable 15.21% accuracy improvement over FlexMatch on STL-10, demonstrate that
RelationMatch not only advances state-of-the-art performance but also provides
a principled foundation for incorporating relational cues in SSL.

intelligence (AI) models, in which devices collaborate with a server to train
an AI model in a distributed manner, based on a same fixed split point.
However, due to the device heterogeneity and variation of channel conditions,
this way is not optimal in training delay and energy consumption. In this
paper, we design an adaptive split learning (ASL) scheme which can dynamically
select split points for devices and allocate computing resource for the server
in wireless edge networks. We formulate an optimization problem to minimize the
average training latency subject to long-term energy consumption constraint.
The difficulties in solving this problem are the lack of future information and
mixed integer programming (MIP). To solve it, we propose an online algorithm
leveraging the Lyapunov theory, named OPEN, which decomposes it into a new MIP
problem only with the current information. Then, a two-layer optimization
method is proposed to solve the MIP problem. Extensive simulation results
demonstrate that the ASL scheme can reduce the average training delay and
energy consumption by 53.7% and 22.1%, respectively, as compared to the
existing SL schemes.

handling of error components with varying frequencies and overcomes constraints
on the number of grid points per wavelength on coarse grids. Furthermore, we
provide an efficient implementation using differentiable programming, making
Wave-ADR-NS an end-to-end Helmholtz solver that incorporates parameters learned

models are trained to generalize to unseen data using a limited amount of
labeled examples from a single modality. However, real-world data are
inherently multi-modal, and such unimodal approaches limit the practical
applications of few-shot learning. To bridge this gap, this paper introduces
the Cross-modal Few-Shot Learning (CFSL) task, which aims to recognize
instances across multiple modalities while relying on scarce labeled data. This
task presents unique challenges compared to classical few-shot learning arising
from the distinct visual attributes and structural disparities inherent to each
modality. To tackle these challenges, we propose a Generative Transfer Learning
(GTL) framework by simulating how humans abstract and generalize concepts.
Specifically, the GTL jointly estimates the latent shared concept across
modalities and the in-modality disturbance through a generative structure.
Establishing the relationship between latent concepts and visual content among
abundant unimodal data enables GTL to effectively transfer knowledge from
unimodal to novel multimodal data, as humans did. Comprehensive experiments
demonstrate that the GTL achieves state-of-the-art performance across seven
multi-modal datasets across RGB-Sketch, RGB-Infrared, and RGB-Depth.

our DDE. The first is stepwise estimation, which utilizes the conditional
denoised distribution to estimate the model denoised distribution. The second
is single-shot estimation, which converts the model output into the terminal
denoised distribution via DDIM modeling. Analytically and empirically, we
reveal that DDE equipped with two estimation strategies naturally derives a
novel credit assignment scheme that prioritizes optimizing the middle part of
the denoising trajectory. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our approach
achieves superior performance, both quantitatively and qualitatively.

To overcome those challenges, we propose to rethink robot world models as
learnable digital twins. We introduce DreMa, a new approach for constructing
digital twins automatically using learned explicit representations of the real

study explores data-driven methods, in particular deep learning, for tool wear
prediction. Traditional data-driven approaches often focus on a single process,
relying on multi-sensor setups and extensive data generation, which limits
generalization to new settings. Moreover, multi-sensor integration is often
impractical in industrial environments. To address these limitations, this
research investigates the transferability of predictive models using minimal
training data, validated across two processes. Furthermore, it uses a simple
setup with a single acceleration sensor to establish a low-cost data generation
approach that facilitates the generalization of models to other processes via
transfer learning. The study evaluates several machine learning models,
including transformer-inspired convolutional neural networks (CNN), long
short-term memory networks (LSTM), support vector machines (SVM), and decision
trees, trained on different input formats such as feature vectors and
short-time Fourier transform (STFT). The performance of the models is evaluated
on two machines and on different amounts of training data, including scenarios

specific models and configurations for effective tool wear prediction,
contributing to the development of more adaptable and efficient predictive

decomposition is guided by a covariance matrix from replay samples, ensuring
principal components align with classification abilities. During adaptation, we
freeze the knowledge-sensitive components and only adapt the redundant-capacity
components, fostering plasticity while minimizing interference without changing
the architecture or increasing overhead. Additionally, CKPD introduces an

dynamically allocating adapters. Experiments on multiple benchmarks show that

analytics, particularly in the context of regression. While existing research
has primarily focused on batch learning from static datasets, limited attention
has been given to imbalanced regression in online learning scenarios. Intending
to address this gap, in prior work, we proposed sampling strategies based on
Chebyshevs inequality as the first methodologies designed explicitly for data
streams. However, these approaches operated under the restrictive assumption
that rare instances exclusively reside at distribution extremes. This study
introduces histogram-based sampling strategies to overcome this constraint,
proposing flexible solutions for imbalanced regression in evolving data
streams. The proposed techniques -- Histogram-based Undersampling (HistUS) and
Histogram-based Oversampling (HistOS) -- employ incremental online histograms
to dynamically detect and prioritize rare instances across arbitrary regions of
the target distribution to improve predictions in the rare cases. Comprehensive
experiments on synthetic and real-world benchmarks demonstrate that HistUS and
HistOS substantially improve rare-case prediction accuracy, outperforming
baseline models while maintaining competitiveness with Chebyshev-based
approaches.

  Learning",31 pages 4 figures,,,,stat.ML cs.AI cs.LG,http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/,"  Accurate prediction with multimodal data-encompassing tabular, textual, and
visual inputs or outputs-is fundamental to advancing analytics in diverse
application domains. Traditional approaches often struggle to integrate
heterogeneous data types while maintaining high predictive accuracy. We
introduce Generative Distribution Prediction (GDP), a novel framework that
leverages multimodal synthetic data generation-such as conditional diffusion
models-to enhance predictive performance across structured and unstructured
modalities. GDP is model-agnostic, compatible with any high-fidelity generative
model, and supports transfer learning for domain adaptation. We establish a
rigorous theoretical foundation for GDP, providing statistical guarantees on
its predictive accuracy when using diffusion models as the generative backbone.
By estimating the data-generating distribution and adapting to various loss
functions for risk minimization, GDP enables accurate point predictions across
multimodal settings. We empirically validate GDP on four supervised learning
tasks-tabular data prediction, question answering, image captioning, and
adaptive quantile regression-demonstrating its versatility and effectiveness
across diverse domains.

mm-Wave passive networks that leverages knowledge transfer from a pre-trained
synthesis neural network (NN) model in one technology node and achieves swift
and reliable design adaptation across different integrated circuit (IC)
technologies, operating frequencies, and metal options. We prove this concept
through simulation-based demonstrations focusing on the training and comparison
of the coefficient of determination (R2) of synthesis NNs for 1:1 on-chip
transformers in GlobalFoundries(GF) 22nm FDX+ (target domain), with and without
transfer learning from a model trained in GF 45nm SOI (source domain). In the
experiments, we explore varying target data densities of 0.5%, 1%, 5%, and 100%
with a complete dataset of 0.33 million in GF 22FDX+, and for comparative
analysis, apply source data densities of 25%, 50%, 75%, and 100% with a
complete dataset of 2.5 million in GF 45SOI. With the source data only at
30GHz, the experiments span target data from two metal options in GF 22FDX+ at
frequencies of 30 and 39 GHz. The results prove that the transfer learning with
the source domain knowledge (GF 45SOI) can both accelerate the training process
in the target domain (GF 22FDX+) and improve the R2 values compared to models
without knowledge transfer. Furthermore, it is observed that a model trained
with just 5% of target data and augmented by transfer learning achieves R2
values superior to a model trained with 20% of the data without transfer,
validating the advantage seen from 1% to 5% data density. This demonstrates a
notable reduction of 4X in the necessary dataset size highlighting the efficacy
of utilizing transfer learning to mm-Wave passive network design. The PyTorch

  from Chest Radiography via Tri-Modal Contrastive Learning","11 pages, 1 figure, 5 tables",,,,cs.CV cs.LG,http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-sa/4.0/,"  Computed tomography (CT) is a key imaging modality for diagnosis, yet its
clinical utility is marred by high radiation exposure and long turnaround
times, restricting its use for larger-scale screening. Although chest
radiography (CXR) is more accessible and safer, existing CXR foundation models
focus primarily on detecting diseases that are readily visible on the CXR.
Recently, works have explored training disease classification models on
simulated CXRs, but they remain limited to recognizing a single disease type
from CT. CT foundation models have also emerged with significantly improved
detection of pathologies in CT. However, the generalized application of
CT-derived labels on CXR has remained illusive. In this study, we propose
X2CT-CLIP, a tri-modal knowledge transfer learning framework that bridges the
modality gap between CT and CXR while reducing the computational burden of
model training. Our approach is the first work to enable multi-abnormality
classification in CT, using CXR, by transferring knowledge from 3D CT volumes
and associated radiology reports to a CXR encoder via a carefully designed
tri-modal alignment mechanism in latent space. Extensive evaluations on three
multi-label CT datasets demonstrate that our method outperforms
state-of-the-art baselines in cross-modal retrieval, few-shot adaptation, and
external validation. These results highlight the potential of CXR, enriched
with knowledge derived from CT, as a viable efficient alternative for disease
detection in resource-limited settings.

LLM-based Conversational Shopping Agents (CSA) have been developed to help
customers answer questions and smooth their shopping journey in e-commerce
domain. The primary objective in building a trustworthy CSA is to ensure the
agent's responses are accurate and factually grounded, which is essential for
building customer trust and encouraging continuous engagement. However, two
challenges remain. First, LLMs produce hallucinated or unsupported claims. Such
inaccuracies risk spreading misinformation and diminishing customer trust.
Second, without providing knowledge source attribution in CSA response,
customers struggle to verify LLM-generated information. To address these
challenges, we present an easily productionized solution that enables a
""citation experience"" utilizing In-context Learning (ICL) and
Multi-UX-Inference (MUI) to generate responses with citations to attribute its
original sources without interfering other existing UX features. With proper UX
design, these citation marks can be linked to the related product information
and display the source to our customers. In this work, we also build
auto-metrics and scalable benchmarks to holistically evaluate LLM's grounding
and attribution capabilities. Our experiments demonstrate that incorporating
this citation generation paradigm can substantially enhance the grounding of
LLM responses by 13.83% on the real-world data. As such, our solution not only
addresses the immediate challenges of LLM grounding issues but also adds
transparency to conversational AI.

multimodal collaboration remains under-exploited due to disparities in data
quality and modality representation capabilities. To address this, we introduce
DynCIM, a novel dynamic curriculum learning framework designed to quantify the
inherent imbalances from both sample and modality perspectives. DynCIM employs
a sample-level curriculum to dynamically assess each sample's difficulty
according to prediction deviation, consistency, and stability, while a
modality-level curriculum measures modality contributions from global and
local. Furthermore, a gating-based dynamic fusion mechanism is introduced to
adaptively adjust modality contributions, minimizing redundancy and optimizing
fusion effectiveness. Extensive experiments on six multimodal benchmarking
datasets, spanning both bimodal and trimodal scenarios, demonstrate that DynCIM
consistently outperforms state-of-the-art methods. Our approach effectively
mitigates modality and sample imbalances while enhancing adaptability and
robustness in multimodal learning tasks. Our code is available at

  Commonsense Reasoning",,,,,cs.CL,http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-sa/4.0/,"  Commonsense reasoning (CR) has been studied in many pieces of domain and has
achieved great progress with the aid of large datasets. Unfortunately, most
existing CR datasets are built in English, so most previous work focus on
English. Furthermore, as the annotation of commonsense reasoning is costly, it
is impossible to build a large dataset for every novel task. Therefore, there
are growing appeals for Cross-lingual Low-Resource Commonsense Reasoning, which
aims to leverage diverse existed English datasets to help the model adapt to
new cross-lingual target datasets with limited labeled data. In this paper, we
propose a multi-source adapter for cross-lingual low-resource Commonsense
Reasoning (MetaXCR). In this framework, we first extend meta learning by
incorporating multiple training datasets to learn a generalized task adapters
across different tasks. Then, we further introduce a reinforcement-based
sampling strategy to help the model sample the source task that is the most
helpful to the target task. Finally, we introduce two types of cross-lingual
meta-adaption methods to enhance the performance of models on target languages.
Extensive experiments demonstrate MetaXCR is superior over state-of-the-arts,
while being trained with fewer parameters than other work.
