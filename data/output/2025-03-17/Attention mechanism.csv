growing interest in sparse attention mechanisms that align more closely with
localized, contextual learning in the biological brain. Existing studies such
as the Coordination method employ iterative cross-attention mechanisms with a
bottleneck to enable the sparse association of inputs. However, these methods
are parameter inefficient and fail in more complex relational reasoning tasks.
To this end, we propose Associative Transformer (AiT) to enhance the
association among sparsely attended input tokens, improving parameter
efficiency and performance in various vision tasks such as classification and
relational reasoning. AiT leverages a learnable explicit memory comprising
specialized priors that guide bottleneck attentions to facilitate the
extraction of diverse localized tokens. Moreover, AiT employs an associative
memory-based token reconstruction using a Hopfield energy function. The
extensive empirical experiments demonstrate that AiT requires significantly
fewer parameters and attention layers outperforming a broad range of sparse
Transformer models. Additionally, AiT outperforms the SOTA sparse Transformer
models including the Coordination method on the Sort-of-CLEVR dataset.

size apple fruitlets. State-of-the-art viewpoint planners in agriculture are
designed to size large and more sparsely populated fruit. They rely on lower
resolution maps and sizing methods that do not generalize to smaller fruit
sizes. To overcome these limitations, our method combines viewpoint sampling
around semantically labeled regions of interest, along with an attention-guided
information gain mechanism to more strategically select viewpoints that target
the small fruits' volume. Additionally, we integrate a dual-map representation
of the environment that is able to both speed up expensive ray casting
operations and maintain the high occupancy resolution required to informatively
plan around the fruit. When sizing, a robust estimation and graph clustering
approach is introduced to associate fruit detections across images. Through
simulated experiments, we demonstrate that our viewpoint planner improves
sizing accuracy compared to state of the art and ablations. We also provide
quantitative results on data collected by a real robotic system in the field.

acquisition devices garner significant attention. However, EEG channel
selection methods are commonly data-sensitive and cannot establish a unified
sound paradigm for EEG acquisition devices. Through reverse conceptualisation,
we formulated EEG applications in an EEG super-resolution (SR) manner, but
suffered from high computation costs, extra interpolation bias, and few
insights into spatiotemporal dependency modelling. To this end, we propose
ESTformer, an EEG SR framework that utilises spatiotemporal dependencies based
on the transformer. ESTformer applies positional encoding methods and a
multihead self-attention mechanism to the space and time dimensions, which can
learn spatial structural correlations and temporal functional variations.
ESTformer, with the fixed mask strategy, adopts a mask token to upsample
low-resolution (LR) EEG data in the case of disturbance from mathematical
interpolation methods. On this basis, we designed various transformer blocks to
construct a spatial interpolation module (SIM) and a temporal reconstruction
module (TRM). Finally, ESTformer cascades the SIM and TRM to capture and model
the spatiotemporal dependencies for EEG SR with fidelity. Extensive
experimental results on two EEG datasets show the effectiveness of ESTformer
against previous state-of-the-art methods, demonstrating the versatility of the
Transformer for EEG SR tasks. The superiority of the SR data was verified in an
EEG-based person identification and emotion recognition task, achieving a 2% to
38% improvement compared with the LR data at different sampling scales.

expression recognition, face recognition, and face visibility. Traditional face
analysis approaches rely on task-specific architectures and pre-processing

employs a transformer-based encoder-decoder architecture, where each task is
represented as a learnable token, enabling seamless multi-task processing
within a unified model. To enhance efficiency, we introduce FaceX, a
lightweight decoder with a novel bi-directional cross-attention mechanism,
which jointly processes face and task tokens to learn robust and generalized
facial representations. We train FaceXFormer on ten diverse face perception
datasets and evaluate it against both specialized and multi-task models across
multiple benchmarks, demonstrating state-of-the-art or competitive performance.
Additionally, we analyze the impact of various components of FaceXFormer on

algorithm by reinterpreting its core mechanisms within the framework of Path
Integral formalism. In this perspective, the attention mechanism is recast as a
process that integrates all possible transition paths leading to future token
states, with temporal evolution governed by the Feed-Forward Network. By
systematically mapping each component of the Transformer to its counterpart in
the Path Integral formulation, we obtain a more compact and efficient
representation, in which the contextual information of a sequence is condensed
into memory-like segments. These segments are recurrently processed across
Transformer layers, enabling more effective long-term information retention. We
validate the effectiveness of this approach through the Passkey retrieval task
and a summarization task, demonstrating that the proposed method preserves
historical information while exhibiting memory usage that scales linearly with
sequence length. This contrasts with the non-linear memory growth typically
observed in standard attention mechanisms. We expect that this quantum-inspired
generalization of the Transformer architecture will open new avenues for
enhancing both the efficiency and expressiveness of future Transformer models.

revolutionized the landscape of network design across various vision tasks.
While self-attention is extensively explored as a key factor in performance,
FFN has received little attention. FFN is a versatile operator seamlessly
integrated into nearly all AI models to effectively harness rich
representations. Recent works also show that FFN functions like key-value
memories. Thus, akin to the query-key-value mechanism within self-attention,
FFN can be viewed as a memory network, where the input serves as query and the
two projection weights operate as keys and values, respectively. Based on these
observations, we hypothesize that the importance lies in query-key-value
framework itself for competitive performance. To verify this, we propose
converting self-attention into a more FFN-like efficient token mixer with only
convolutions while retaining query-key-value framework, namely FFNification.
Specifically, FFNification replaces query-key-value interactions with large
kernel convolutions and adopts GELU activation function instead of softmax. The
derived token mixer, FFNified attention, serves as key-value memories for
detecting locally distributed spatial patterns, and operates in the opposite
dimension to the ConvNeXt block within each corresponding sub-operation of the
query-key-value framework. Building upon the above two modules, we present a
family of Fast-Forward Networks (FFNet). Despite being composed of only simple
operators, FFNet outperforms sophisticated and highly specialized methods in
each domain, with notable efficiency gains. These results validate our
hypothesis, leading us to propose MetaMixer, a general mixer architecture that
does not specify sub-operations within the query-key-value framework.

interpolation lack mathematical interpretability, require voluminous training
data to tune a large parameter set, and are fragile in the face of covariate
shift. To address these shortcomings, we build interpretable networks by
unrolling variants of a graph-based optimization algorithm of different
complexities. Specifically, for a general linear image formation model, we
first formulate a convex quadratic programming (QP) problem with a new
$\ell_2$-norm graph smoothness prior called gradient graph Laplacian
regularizer (GGLR) that promotes piecewise planar (PWP) signal reconstruction.
To solve the posed unconstrained QP problem, instead of computing a linear
system solution straightforwardly, we introduce a variable number of auxiliary
variables and correspondingly design a family of ADMM algorithms. We then
unroll them into variable-complexity feed-forward networks, amenable to
parameter tuning via back-propagation. More complex unrolled networks require
more labeled data to train more parameters, but have better overall
performance. The unrolled networks have periodic insertions of a graph learning
module, akin to a self-attention mechanism in a transformer architecture, to
learn pairwise similarity structure inherent in data. Experimental results show
that our unrolled networks perform competitively to generic DL networks in
image restoration quality while using only a fraction of parameters, and
demonstrate improved robustness to covariate shift.

safety for physical agents remains an open challenge. For a human-in-the-loop
language-operated drone to navigate safely, it must understand natural language
commands, perceive the environment, and simultaneously avoid hazards in real
time. Control Barrier Functions (CBFs) are formal methods that enforce safe
operating conditions. Model Predictive Control (MPC) is an optimization
framework that plans a sequence of future actions over a prediction horizon,
ensuring smooth trajectory tracking while obeying constraints. In this work, we
consider a VLN-operated drone platform and enhance its safety by formulating a
novel scene-aware CBF that leverages ego-centric observations from a camera
which has both Red-Green-Blue as well as Depth (RGB-D) channels. A CBF-less
baseline system uses a Vision-Language Encoder with cross-modal attention to
convert commands into an ordered sequence of landmarks. An object detection
model identifies and verifies these landmarks in the captured images to
generate a planned path. To further enhance safety, an Adaptive Safety Margin
Algorithm (ASMA) is proposed. ASMA tracks moving objects and performs
scene-aware CBF evaluation on-the-fly, which serves as an additional constraint
within the MPC framework. By continuously identifying potentially risky
observations, the system performs prediction in real time about unsafe
conditions and proactively adjusts its control actions to maintain safe
navigation throughout the trajectory. Deployed on a Parrot Bebop2 quadrotor in
the Gazebo environment using the Robot Operating System (ROS), ASMA achieves
64%-67% increase in success rates with only a slight increase (1.4%-5.8%) in
trajectory lengths compared to the baseline CBF-less VLN.

a latent property of the model via backpropagation and requires no external

monotonic nature of TTS input-output alignment, it is still able to benefit
from the flexible modeling power of interleaved multi-head self- and

This design reflects a fundamental principle in chemical reactions: the crucial
role of reagents in influencing bond-breaking and formation processes, which
ultimately affect reaction yields. log-RRIM also implements a local-to-global
reaction representation learning strategy. This approach initially captures
detailed molecule-level information and then models and aggregates
intermolecular interactions. Through this hierarchical process, log-RRIM
effectively captures how different molecular fragments contribute to and
influence the overall reaction yield, regardless of their size variations.
log-RRIM shows superior performance in our experiments, especially for medium

computationally expensive, particularly due to its quadratic complexity, posing
significant challenges in vision applications. In contrast, linear attention
provides a far more efficient solution by reducing the complexity to linear
levels. However, compared to Softmax attention, linear attention often
experiences significant performance degradation. Our experiments indicate that
this performance drop is due to the low-rank nature of linear attention's
feature map, which hinders its ability to adequately model complex spatial
information. In this paper, to break the low-rank dilemma of linear attention,
we conduct rank analysis from two perspectives: the KV buffer and the output
features. Consequently, we introduce Rank-Augmented Linear Attention (RALA),
which rivals the performance of Softmax attention while maintaining linear
complexity and high efficiency. Based on RALA, we construct the Rank-Augmented
Vision Linear Transformer (RAVLT). Extensive experiments demonstrate that RAVLT
achieves excellent performance across various vision tasks. Specifically,
without using any additional labels, data, or supervision during training,
RAVLT achieves an 84.4% Top-1 accuracy on ImageNet-1k with only 26M parameters
and 4.6G FLOPs. This result significantly surpasses previous linear attention
mechanisms, fully illustrating the potential of RALA. Code will be available at

in representing the true data relationships, degrading fusion performance. To
address this issue, a novel SPD (symmetric positive definite) manifold learning
framework is proposed for multi-modal image fusion, named SPDFusion, which
extends the image fusion approach from the Euclidean space to the SPD
manifolds. Specifically, we encode images according to the Riemannian geometry
to exploit their intrinsic statistical correlations, thereby aligning with
human visual perception. Actually, the SPD matrix underpins our network
learning, with a cross-modal fusion strategy employed to harness
modality-specific dependencies and augment complementary information.
Subsequently, an attention module is designed to process the learned weight
matrix, facilitating the weighting of spatial global correlation semantics via
SPD matrix multiplication. Based on this, we design an end-to-end fusion
network based on cross-modal manifold learning. Extensive experiments on public
datasets demonstrate that our framework exhibits superior performance compared
to the current state-of-the-art methods.

  Isolation and Reposition Attention",,,,,cs.CV,http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/,"  Training-free diffusion models have achieved remarkable progress in
generating multi-subject consistent images within open-domain scenarios. The
key idea of these methods is to incorporate reference subject information
within the attention layer. However, existing methods still obtain suboptimal
performance when handling numerous subjects. This paper reveals two primary
issues contributing to this deficiency. Firstly, the undesired internal
attraction between different subjects within the target image can lead to the
convergence of multiple subjects into a single entity. Secondly, tokens tend to
reference nearby tokens, which reduces the effectiveness of the attention
mechanism when there is a significant positional difference between subjects in
reference and target images. To address these issues, we propose a
training-free diffusion model with Isolation and Reposition Attention, named
IR-Diffusion. Specifically, Isolation Attention ensures that multiple subjects
in the target image do not reference each other, effectively eliminating the
subject convergence. On the other hand, Reposition Attention involves scaling
and repositioning subjects in both reference and target images to the same
position within the images. This ensures that subjects in the target image can
better reference those in the reference image, thereby maintaining better
consistency. Extensive experiments demonstrate that IR-Diffusion significantly
enhances multi-subject consistency, outperforming all existing methods in
open-domain scenarios.

motivates us to propose a new video inpainting framework using optical

Specifically, FloED employs a dual-branch architecture, where the time-agnostic

provide motion guidance to the main inpainting branch. Besides, a training-free
latent interpolation method is proposed to accelerate the multi-step denoising
process using flow warping. With the flow attention cache mechanism, FLoED
efficiently reduces the computational cost of incorporating optical flow.
Extensive experiments on background restoration and object removal tasks show
that FloED outperforms state-of-the-art diffusion-based methods in both quality

applications such as autonomous driving, augmented reality and supply chain

class of latency attacks are reported recently. They exploit new attack
surfaces in object detectors by creating a computational bottleneck in the

downstream tasks at risks. In this work, we take an initial attempt to defend
against this attack via background-attentive adversarial training that is also
cognizant of the underlying hardware capabilities. We first draw system-level
connections between latency attack and hardware capacity across heterogeneous
GPU devices. Based on the particular adversarial behaviors, we utilize
objectness loss as a proxy and build background attention into the adversarial
training pipeline, and achieve a reasonable balance between clean and robust
accuracy. The extensive experiments demonstrate the defense effectiveness of
restoring real-time processing capability from $13$ FPS to $43$ FPS on Jetson

in-shop videos). However, these mask-based approaches struggle with complex
real-world scenarios, as overly large and inconsistent masks often destroy
spatial-temporal information, leading to distorted results. Mask-free methods
alleviate this issue but face challenges in accurately determining the try-on
area, especially for videos with dynamic body movements. To address these
limitations, we propose PEMF-VTO, a novel Point-Enhanced Mask-Free Video

Temporal Attention (PTA), which leverages frame-frame point correspondences to
enhance temporal coherence and ensure smooth transitions across frames.

  Generation",UNDER REVIEW,,,,cs.SE,http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/,"  Recent studies have proposed integrating Chain-of-Thought (CoT) reasoning to
further enhance the reliability of Code Language Models (CLMs) in generating
code, a step-by-step approach that breaks down complex programming tasks into
manageable sub-problems. Advances in this area have introduced CoT models,
specifically designed to integrate CoT reasoning effectively into language
models, achieving notable improvements in code generation. Despite these
advancements, the security of CoT models has not been systematically studied.
In this study, we aim to fill this gap by investigating the vulnerability of
CoT models to backdoor injection in code generation tasks. To address this, we
propose a model-agnostic backdoor attack method SABER (Self-Attention-BasEd
backdooR) based on the self-attention mechanism. SABER begins by selecting a
malicious output as the backdoor using code mutation operations. It then
identifies the tokens most relevant to poisoned content by analyzing
self-attention scores in the CodeBERT model. Finally, it mimicks user behavior
to generate adaptive and natural triggers. Our experiments on HumanEval-CoT and
OpenEval-CoT test sets demonstrate that CoT models are susceptible to backdoor
attacks via data poisoning. Taking the HumanEval-CoT dataset as an example,
SABER achieves an ASR of 80.95%, representing an improvement of 33.33% over
RIPPLe and a substantial 4.76% enhancement compared to BadPre. Further
evaluations using ONION for automated detection and human studies reveal that
SABER is stealthier and harder to detect, bypassing 61.90% of automated
detection, with a human detection rate of just 3.17%. Our findings reveal that
backdoors can be injected into CoT models to manipulate downstream code
generation tasks. This highlights the urgent need for further research to
understand and mitigate the security vulnerabilities in CoT models.

general, in cases for which the GPT model generates moves that do not adhere to
the game rules, it also fails to capture any causal structure.

advancements in diffusion-based models. In this paper, we propose a proactive
defense method named FaceShield, which introduces novel defense strategies

defenses on various existing GAN-based deepfake models through facial feature

manipulating the attention mechanism of DMs to exclude protected facial

details of the generated images, we propose Attention Activation and
Suppression (ASS), which re-engineers the self-attention mechanism within the
pre-trained diffusion models based on the given mask, thereby prioritizing the
background over the foreground object during the reverse generation process.
Moreover, we introduce Self-Attention Redirection Guidance (SARG), which
utilizes the self-attention redirected by ASS to guide the generation process,
effectively removing foreground objects within the mask while simultaneously
generating content that is both plausible and coherent. Experiments demonstrate
the stability and effectiveness of Attentive Eraser in object removal across a

proposes a novel semi-supervised Multi-Scale Uncertainty and

Cross-Teacher-Student attention mechanism to guide the student network, guiding
the student network to construct more discriminative feature representations

effectively integrates weak and strong augmentations (WA and SA) to further
boost segmentation performance. To verify the effectiveness of our model, we
conduct extensive experiments on ISPRS-Potsdam and LoveDA datasets. The

images captured in poorly lit conditions, which often suffer from low
brightness, low contrast, noise, and color distortions. These issues hinder the
performance of computer vision tasks such as object detection, facial

multi-scale fusion and histogram equalization, fail to preserve fine details

foundation for image decomposition, it often amplifies noise, leading to
suboptimal image quality. In this paper, we propose the Dual Light Enhance

for 3D visual grounding. Conventional methods are difficult to meet the
requirements of real-time inference due to the two-stage or point-based
architecture. Inspired by the success of multi-level fully sparse convolutional
architecture in 3D object detection, we aim to build a new 3D visual grounding
framework following this technical route. However, as in 3D visual grounding
task the 3D scene representation should be deeply interacted with text

interaction due to the large amount of voxel features. To this end, we propose
text-guided pruning (TGP) and completion-based addition (CBA) to deeply fuse 3D

pruning and target completion. Specifically, TGP iteratively sparsifies the 3D
scene representation and thus efficiently interacts the voxel features with

geometric information, CBA adaptively fixes the over-pruned region by voxel
completion with negligible computational overhead. Compared with previous

attention due to the impressive success of diffusion models. However, these
models require substantial computational resources. To address these
challenges, we propose a world model leveraging object-centric representation
space using slot attention, guided by language instructions. Our model
perceives the current state as an object-centric representation and predicts
future states in this representation space conditioned on natural language
instructions. This approach results in a more compact and computationally
efficient model compared to diffusion-based generative alternatives.
Furthermore, it flexibly predicts future states based on language instructions,
and offers a significant advantage in manipulation tasks where object
recognition is crucial. In this paper, we demonstrate that our latent
predictive world model surpasses generative world models in visuo-linguo-motor
control tasks, achieving superior sample and computation efficiency. We also
investigate the generalization performance of the proposed method and explore
various strategies for predicting actions using object-centric representations.

  Identity Adapter",,,,,cs.CV,http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/,"  Recent advances in diffusion-based lip-syncing generative models have
demonstrated their ability to produce highly synchronized talking face videos
for visual dubbing. Although these models excel at lip synchronization, they
often struggle to maintain fine-grained control over facial details in
generated images. In this work, we identify ""lip averaging"" phenomenon where
the model fails to preserve subtle facial details when dubbing unseen
in-the-wild videos. This issue arises because the commonly used UNet backbone
primarily integrates audio features into visual representations in the latent
space via cross-attention mechanisms and multi-scale fusion, but it struggles
to retain fine-grained lip details in the generated faces. To address this
issue, we propose UnAvgLip, which extracts identity embeddings from reference
videos to generate highly faithful facial sequences while maintaining accurate
lip synchronization. Specifically, our method comprises two primary components:
(1) an Identity Perceiver module that encodes facial embeddings to align with
conditioned audio features; and (2) an ID-CrossAttn module that injects facial
embeddings into the generation process, enhancing model's capability of
identity retention. Extensive experiments demonstrate that, at a modest
training and inference cost, UnAvgLip effectively mitigates the ""averaging""
phenomenon in lip inpainting, significantly preserving unique facial
characteristics while maintaining precise lip synchronization. Compared with
the original approach, our method demonstrates significant improvements of 5%
on the identity consistency metric and 2% on the SSIM metric across two
benchmark datasets (HDTF and LRW).

to the complex and complementary interactions between different modalities.
Audio and textual cues are particularly important for understanding emotions
from a human perspective. Most existing studies focus on exploring interactions
between audio and text modalities at the same representation level. However, a
critical issue is often overlooked: the heterogeneous modality gap between
low-level audio representations and high-level text representations. To address
this problem, we propose a novel framework called Heterogeneous Bimodal
Attention Fusion (HBAF) for multi-level multi-modal interaction in
conversational emotion recognition. The proposed method comprises three key
modules: the uni-modal representation module, the multi-modal fusion module,
and the inter-modal contrastive learning module. The uni-modal representation
module incorporates contextual content into low-level audio representations to
bridge the heterogeneous multi-modal gap, enabling more effective fusion. The
multi-modal fusion module uses dynamic bimodal attention and a dynamic gating
mechanism to filter incorrect cross-modal relationships and fully exploit both
intra-modal and inter-modal interactions. Finally, the inter-modal contrastive
learning module captures complex absolute and relative interactions between
audio and text modalities. Experiments on the MELD and IEMOCAP datasets
demonstrate that the proposed HBAF method outperforms existing state-of-the-art
baselines.

  Learning",Published as a conference paper at IJCLR'24,,,,cs.LG cs.AI cs.CV,http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/,"  Visual generative abductive learning studies jointly training symbol-grounded
neural visual generator and inducing logic rules from data, such that after
learning, the visual generation process is guided by the induced logic rules. A
major challenge for this task is to reduce the time cost of logic abduction
during learning, an essential step when the logic symbol set is large and the
logic rule to induce is complicated. To address this challenge, we propose a
pre-training method for obtaining meta-rule selection policy for the recently
proposed visual generative learning approach AbdGen [Peng et al., 2023], aiming
at significantly reducing the candidate meta-rule set and pruning the search
space. The selection model is built based on the embedding representation of
both symbol grounding of cases and meta-rules, which can be effectively
integrated with both neural model and logic reasoning system. The pre-training
process is done on pure symbol data, not involving symbol grounding learning of
raw visual inputs, making the entire learning process low-cost. An additional
interesting observation is that the selection policy can rectify symbol
grounding errors unseen during pre-training, which is resulted from the
memorization ability of attention mechanism and the relative stability of
symbolic patterns. Experimental results show that our method is able to
effectively address the meta-rule selection problem for visual abduction,
boosting the efficiency of visual generative abductive learning. Code is

  Body Embeddings for Recognition and Identification",,,,,cs.CV,http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/,"  Person Re-identification (ReID) systems identify individuals across images or
video frames and play a critical role in various real-world applications.
However, many ReID methods are influenced by sensitive attributes such as
gender, pose, and body mass index (BMI), which vary in uncontrolled
environments, leading to biases and reduced generalization. To address this, we
extend the concept of expressivity to the body recognition domain to better
understand how ReID models encode these attributes. Expressivity, defined as
the mutual information between feature vector representations and specific
attributes, is computed using a secondary neural network that takes feature and
attribute vectors as inputs. This provides a quantitative framework for
analyzing the extent to which sensitive attributes are embedded in the model's
representations. We apply expressivity analysis to SemReID, a state-of-the-art
self-supervised ReID model, and find that BMI consistently exhibits the highest
expressivity scores in the model's final layers, underscoring its dominant role
in feature encoding. In the final attention layer of the trained network, the
expressivity order for body attributes is BMI > Pitch > Yaw > Gender,
highlighting their relative importance in learned representations.
Additionally, expressivity values evolve progressively across network layers
and training epochs, reflecting a dynamic encoding of attributes during feature
extraction. These insights emphasize the influence of body-related attributes
on ReID models and provide a systematic methodology for identifying and
mitigating attribute-driven biases. By leveraging expressivity analysis, we
offer valuable tools to enhance the fairness, robustness, and generalization of
ReID systems in diverse real-world settings.

network architectures. However, existing layer attention methods suffer from
redundancy, as attention weights learned by adjacent layers often become highly
similar. This redundancy causes multiple layers to extract nearly identical
features, reducing the model's representational capacity and increasing
training time. To address this issue, we propose a novel approach to quantify
redundancy by leveraging the Kullback-Leibler (KL) divergence between adjacent
layers. Additionally, we introduce an Enhanced Beta Quantile Mapping (EBQM)
method that accurately identifies and skips redundant layers, thereby
maintaining model stability. Our proposed Efficient Layer Attention (ELA)
architecture, improves both training efficiency and overall performance,
achieving a 30\% reduction in training time while enhancing performance in

personalized human image generation, which aims to create novel images
featuring specific human identities as reference images indicate. Although
existing methods achieve high-fidelity identity preservation, they often
struggle with limited multi-ID usability and inadequate facial editability. We
present DynamicID, a tuning-free framework supported by a dual-stage training
paradigm that inherently facilitates both single-ID and multi-ID personalized
generation with high fidelity and flexible facial editability. Our key
innovations include: 1) Semantic-Activated Attention (SAA), which employs
query-level activation gating to minimize disruption to the original model when
injecting ID features and achieve multi-ID personalization without requiring
multi-ID samples during training. 2) Identity-Motion Reconfigurator (IMR),
which leverages contrastive learning to effectively disentangle and re-entangle
facial motion and identity features, thereby enabling flexible facial editing.
Additionally, we have developed a curated VariFace-10k facial dataset,
comprising 10k unique individuals, each represented by 35 distinct facial
images. Experimental results demonstrate that DynamicID outperforms
state-of-the-art methods in identity fidelity, facial editability, and multi-ID

unseen images based on reference image content. Zero-shot adapter methods such
as IP-Adapter and OminiControl are especially interesting because they do not
require test-time fine-tuning. However, they struggle to balance preserving
personalized content and adherence to the text prompt. We identify a critical
design flaw resulting in this performance gap: current adapters inadequately
integrate personalization images with the textual descriptions. The generated
images, therefore, replicate the personalized content rather than adhere to the
text prompt instructions. Yet the base text-to-image has strong conceptual
understanding capabilities that can be leveraged.
  We propose Conceptrol, a simple yet effective framework that enhances
zero-shot adapters without adding computational overhead. Conceptrol constrains
the attention of visual specification with a textual concept mask that improves
subject-driven generation capabilities. It achieves as much as 89% improvement
on personalization benchmarks over the vanilla IP-Adapter and can even
outperform fine-tuning approaches such as Dreambooth LoRA. The source code is
