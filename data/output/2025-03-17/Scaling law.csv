of semi-linear parabolic SPDEs on $\mathbb{R}_+\times\mathbb{T}$ with
fractional Laplacian $(-\Delta)^{\sigma/2}$, additive noise and polynomial
non-linearity, where $\mathbb{T}$ is the $d$-dimensional torus. We consider the
weakly non-linear regime and not necessarily Gaussian noises which are
stationary, centered, sufficiently regular and satisfy some integrability and
mixing conditions. We prove that the macroscopic scaling limit exists and has a
universal law characterized by parameters of the relevant perturbations of the
linear equation. We develop a new solution theory for singular SPDEs of the
above-mentioned form using the Wilsonian renormalization group theory and the
Polchinski flow equation. In particular, in the case of $d=4$ and the cubic
non-linearity our analysis covers the whole sub-critical regime $\sigma>2$. Our
technique avoids completely all the algebraic and combinatorial problems
arising in different approaches.

input variables have found use in analysis of longitudinal data and computer
experiments. However, standard inference for these models has the typical cubic
scaling, and common scalable approximation schemes for GPs cannot be applied
since the covariance function is non-continuous. In this work, we derive a
basis function approximation scheme for mixed-domain covariance functions,
which scales linearly with respect to the number of observations and total
number of basis functions. The proposed approach is naturally applicable to
also Bayesian GP regression with discrete observation models. We demonstrate
the scalability of the approach and compare model reduction techniques for
additive GP models in a longitudinal data context. We confirm that we can
approximate the exact GP model accurately in a fraction of the runtime compared
to fitting the corresponding exact model. In addition, we demonstrate a
scalable model reduction workflow for obtaining smaller and more interpretable
models when dealing with a large number of candidate predictors.

cells and synthetic self-propelled particles to schools of fish, flocks of
birds, or even human crowds. The theoretical framework describing these systems
has shown tremendous success at finding universal phenomenology. However,
further progress is often burdened by the difficulty of determining the forces
that control the dynamics of the individual elements within each system.
Accessing this local information is key to understanding the physics dominating
the system and to create the models that can explain the observed collective
phenomena. In this work, we present a machine-learning model, a graph neural
network, that uses the collective movement of the system to learn the active
and two-body forces controlling the individual dynamics of the particles. We
verify our approach using numerical simulations of active brownian particles,
considering different interaction potentials and levels of activity. Finally,
we apply our model to experiments of electrophoretic Janus particles,
extracting the active and two-body forces that control the dynamics of the
colloids. Due to this, we can uncover the physics dominating the behavior of
the system. We extract an active force that depends on the electric field and
also area fraction. We also discover a dependence of the two-body interaction
with the electric field that leads us to propose that the dominant force
between these colloids is a screened electrostatic interaction with a constant
length scale. We expect that this methodology can open a new avenue for the
study and modeling of experimental systems of active particles.

may have important applications in soft robotics, sound reduction and
biomedicine. To design these innovative materials, it is important to be able
to simulate them accurately and quickly, in order to tune their mechanical
properties. Since conventional simulations using the finite element method
entail a high computational cost, in this article we aim to develop a machine
learning-based approach that scales favorably to serve as a surrogate model. To
ensure that the model is also able to handle various microstructures, including
those not encountered during training, we include the microstructure as part of
the network input. Therefore, we introduce a graph neural network that predicts
global quantities (energy, stress stiffness) as well as the pattern
transformations that occur (the kinematics). To make our model as accurate and
data-efficient as possible, various symmetries are incorporated into the model.
The starting point is an E(n)-equivariant graph neural network (which respects
translation, rotation and reflection) that has periodic boundary conditions
(i.e., it is in-/equivariant with respect to the choice of RVE), is scale
in-/equivariant, can simulate large deformations, and can predict scalars,
vectors as well as second and fourth order tensors (specifically energy, stress
and stiffness). The incorporation of scale equivariance makes the model
equivariant with respect to the similarities group, of which the Euclidean
group E(n) is a subgroup. We show that this network is more accurate and
data-efficient than graph neural networks with fewer symmetries. To create an
efficient graph representation of the finite element discretization, we use
only the internal geometrical hole boundaries from the finite element mesh to
achieve a better speed-up and scaling with the mesh size.

matrix is modeled in the same way as in the standard DCSBM, while the variance
profile matrix is assumed to be related to the mean adjacency matrix through a
given variance function. Our method of selecting the number of communities is
based on a sequential testing framework. In each step, the weighted DCSBM is
fitted via some spectral clustering method. A key component of our method is
matrix scaling on the estimated variance profile matrix. The resulting scaling
factors can be used to normalize the adjacency matrix, from which the test
statistic is then obtained. Under mild conditions on the weighted DCSBM, our
proposed procedure is shown to be consistent in estimating the true number of
communities. Numerical experiments on both simulated and real-world network

experimental control accompanied by a profound theoretical understanding. At
ultracold temperatures, quantities that appear continuous in everyday life,
such as the motional angular momentum of two colliding particles, become
quantized, leaving a measurable imprint on experimental results. Embedding a
single particle within a larger quantum bath at lowest temperatures can result
in resonant partial-wave dependent interaction, whose strength near zero energy
is dictated by universal threshold scaling laws. Hybrid atom-ion systems have
emerged as a novel platform in which a single charged atom in an ultracold bath
serves as a well-controlled impurity of variable energy. However, entering the
low-energy s-wave regime and exploring the role of higher-partial-wave
scattering within has remained an open challenge. Here, we immerse a Barium ion
in a cloud of ultracold spin-polarized Lithium atoms, realize tunable collision
energies below the s-wave limit and explore resonant higher-partial-wave
scattering by studying the energy dependence of Feshbach resonances. Utilizing
precise electric field control, we tune the collision energy over four orders
of magnitude, reaching from the many-parital-wave to the s-wave regime. At the
lowest energies, we probe the energy dependence of an isolated s-wave Feshbach
resonance and introduce a theoretical model that allows to distinguish it from
higher-partial-wave resonances. Additionally, at energies around the p-wave
barrier, we find and identify an open-channel f-wave resonance, consistent with
threshold laws. Our findings highlight and benchmark the importance of
higher-partial-wave scattering well within the s-wave regime and offer control
over chemical reactions and complex many-body dynamics in atom-ion ensembles -

apply our method to thermal states generated by a blackbody radiator operating
in the regime of circuit quantum electrodynamics. We demonstrate the photon
number resolvedness of the nanobolometer, and reveal the n(n+1)-scaling law of
the photon number variance as indicated by the Bose--Einstein distribution. By
engineering the coherent and incoherent proportions of the input field, we
observe the transition between super-Poissonian and Poissonian statistics of
the microwave photons from the bolometric second-order correlation measurement.

resetting of a system of $N$ noninteracting bosons in a harmonic trap. Our
protocol consists of preparing initially the system in the ground state of a
harmonic oscillator centered at $+a$, followed by a rapid quench where the
center is shifted to $-a$ and the system is allowed to evolve unitarily up to a
random Poissonian time $\tau$ distributed via $r\, e^{-r \tau}$. Then the trap
center is reset to $+a$ again and the system is assumed to cool instantaneously
to the initial ground state. The system is again allowed to evolve unitarily in
the trap centered at $-a$ up to a random time, and the procedure is repeated.
Under repeated resetting, the system reaches a NESS where the positions of
bosons get strongly correlated due to simultaneous resetting induced by the
trap. We fully characterize the steady state by analytically computing several
physical observables such as the average density, extreme value statistics,
order and gap statistics, and also the distribution of the number of particles
in a region $[-L,L]$, known as the full counting statistics (FCS). In
particular, we show that in the large $N$ limit, the scaling function
describing the FCS exhibits a striking feature: it is supported over a
nontrivial finite interval, and moreover is discontinuous at an interior point
of the support. Our results are supported by numerical simulations. This is a
rare example of a strongly correlated quantum many-body NESS where various
observables can be exactly computed.

between detectors to produce an unbiased estimate of the power in Stokes I, Q,
and U parameters on large angular scales. Our results are consistent with the
polarized signal being produced by the combination of Rayleigh scattering of
thermal radiation from the ground and thermal emission from a population of
horizontally aligned ice crystals with an anisotropic distribution described by
Kolmogorov turbulence. The measured spatial scaling, frequency scaling, and
elevation dependence of the polarized emission are explained by this model.
Polarized atmospheric emission has the potential to significantly impact
observations on the large angular scales being targeted by searches for
inflationary B-mode CMB polarization. We present the distribution of measured
angular power spectrum amplitudes in Stokes Q and I for 4 yr of Austral winter
observations, which can be used to simulate the impact of atmospheric
polarization and intensity fluctuations at the South Pole on a specified
experiment and observation strategy. We present a mitigation strategy that
involves both downweighting significantly contaminated observations and
subtracting a polarized atmospheric signal from the 150 GHz band maps. In
observations with the SPT-3G instrument, the polarized atmospheric signal is a
well-understood and subdominant contribution to the measured noise after
implementing the mitigation strategies described here.

  various minor improvements",,,,cond-mat.str-el cond-mat.dis-nn cond-mat.stat-mech,http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/,"  We argue for the existence of a universal phase diagram of quantum chains
with range-$k$ interactions subject to the conservation of a total charge and
its dipole moment. These systems exhibit ""freezing"" transitions between
strongly and weakly Hilbert-space-fragmented phases as the charge filling $\nu$
is varied. We show that these continuous phase transitions occur at a critical
charge filling of $\nu_c=(k-2)^{-1}$ independently of the on-site Hilbert space
dimension $d$. To this end, we analytically prove that for any $d$, any state
for $\nu<\nu_c$ hosts a finite density of sites belonging to ""blockages"", which
we define as subregions of the chain across which transport of charge and
dipole moment cannot occur. Some blockages arise from sequences of frozen
sites, i.e. sites with an unchanging on-site charge, while others do not
involve frozen sites at all. We prove that the presence of blockages implies
strong fragmentation of typical symmetry sectors into Krylov subspaces that
each form an exponentially vanishing fraction of the total sector. By studying
the distribution of blockages we analytically characterise how typical states
are subdivided into dynamically disconnected local ""active bubbles"", and prove
that typical eigenstates at these charge fillings exhibit area-law entanglement
entropy, with rare ""inverse quantum many-body scar"" eigenstates featuring
non-area-law scaling. We also numerically show that for $\nu>\nu_c$ and
arbitrary $d$, typical symmetry sectors are weakly fragmented, with their
dominant Krylov sectors constituted of states that are free of blockages. We
analytically derive some critical exponents characterizing the transition, and
numerically determine the density of blockages at $\nu=\nu_c$, with clear
implications for transport at the critical point. Finally, we investigate the
properties of certain special-case models for which no phase transitions occur.

the competition between AR and external potentials, revealing that

phase diagram that illustrates flocking behavior as a function of active
reorientation and potential asymmetry. We compare the responses of inactive and
active particles to the potential, finding that active reorientation
significantly increases aggregation on one side of the asymmetric potential
well. Additionally, by calculating the mean squared displacement and scaling
exponent, we identify distinct diffusion regimes. Our findings demonstrate that
active particles with active reorientation are more sensitive to variations in
double-well potentials.

due to their diverse applications, ranging from predicting network
generalization and network editing to classifying implicit neural
representation. Previous NFN designs often depend on permutation symmetries in
neural networks' weights, which traditionally arise from the unordered
arrangement of neurons in hidden layers. However, these designs do not take
into account the weight scaling symmetries of $\ReLU$ networks, and the weight
sign flipping symmetries of $\sin$ or $\Tanh$ networks. In this paper, we
extend the study of the group action on the network weights from the group of
permutation matrices to the group of monomial matrices by incorporating
scaling/sign-flipping symmetries. Particularly, we encode these
scaling/sign-flipping symmetries by designing our corresponding equivariant and
invariant layers. We name our new family of NFNs the Monomial Matrix Group
Equivariant Neural Functional Networks (Monomial-NFN). Because of the expansion
of the symmetries, Monomial-NFN has much fewer independent trainable parameters
compared to the baseline NFNs in the literature, thus enhancing the model's
efficiency. Moreover, for fully connected and convolutional neural networks, we
theoretically prove that all groups that leave these networks invariant while
acting on their weight spaces are some subgroups of the monomial matrix group.
We provide empirical evidence to demonstrate the advantages of our model over
existing baselines, achieving competitive performance and efficiency.

Compton-y parameter maps (SZ maps) and bolometric X-ray surface brightness maps

$10^{13.5} h^{-1}M_{\odot}\leq M_{200} \leq 10^{15.5} h^{-1}M_{\odot}$. Despite
the machine learning models being independent of baryonic matter assumptions, a
notable limitation is their dependency on the underlying physics of
hydrodynamical simulations. To evaluate the reliability of our generated
observable maps, we employ various metrics and compare the observable-mass
scaling relations. For clusters with masses greater than $2 \times 10^{14}

specified over general domains using kernel maximum mean discrepancy. Ergodic
trajectory optimization is an effective approach that generates coverage paths
for problems related to robotic inspection, information gathering problems, and
search and rescue. These optimization schemes compel the robot to spend time in
a region proportional to the expected utility of visiting that region. Current
methods for ergodic trajectory optimization rely on domain-specific knowledge,
e.g., a defined utility map, and well-defined spatial basis functions to
produce ergodic trajectories. Here, we present a generalization of ergodic
trajectory optimization based on maximum mean discrepancy that requires only
samples from the search domain. We demonstrate the ability of our approach to
produce coverage trajectories on a variety of problem domains including robotic
inspection of objects with differential kinematics constraints and on Lie
groups without having access to domain specific knowledge. Furthermore, we show
favorable computational scaling compared to existing state-of-the-art methods
for ergodic trajectory optimization with a trade-off between domain specific
knowledge and computational scaling, thus extending the versatility of ergodic
coverage on a wider application domain.

(MLLMs) in the vision understanding domain. The success of these models can
largely be attributed to the dominant scaling law, which states that larger
parameter sizes and data volumes contribute to better performance. Notably,
data scaling has mainly been powered by automatic data pipelines, which center
around the self-instruction of LLMs. The paradigm has been taken for granted
for quite some time, but the study of the effectiveness of scaling with these
data has been neglected for a long time. In this context, this work revisits
scaling with synthetic data and focuses on developing video-LLMs from a
data-centric perspective. Our main study approach is fine-tuning pre-trained
image-LLMs with video data and investigating learning efficiency through data
scaling. Results from our preliminary experiments reveal a low learning
efficiency phenomenon when simply scaling up video data samples, which, through
our probing, can be ascribed to a lack of instruction diversity. Aiming at this
issue, we propose a data augmentation method called Sparrow, which synthesizes
video-like samples from pure text instruction data. Mixing these synthetic
samples with the video data enables a more efficient training scheme. Through
comprehensive experiments, we demonstrate that our proposed method achieves
performance comparable to or even superior to baselines trained with many more
samples. Meanwhile, we find that incorporating these synthetic samples can
boost the performance of long video understanding without training with long
video data. The code and data examples are available at

  Quantum Computer","16 pages, 13 figures, minor improvements",,,,quant-ph,http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/,"  The investigation of strongly-correlated quantum matter is difficult due to
the curse of dimensionality and intricate entanglement structures. These
challenges are particularly pronounced in the vicinity of continuous quantum
phase transitions, where quantum fluctuations manifest across all length
scales. While quantum simulators give controlled access to a number of strongly
correlated systems, the study of critical phenomena has been hampered by
finite-size effects arising from diverging correlation lengths. Moreover, the
experimental investigation of entanglement in many-body systems has been
hindered by limitations in measurement protocols. To address these challenges,
we employ the multiscale entanglement renormalization ansatz (MERA) and
implement a holographic scheme for subsystem tomography on a fully-connected
trapped-ion quantum computer. Our method accurately represents infinite systems
and long-range correlations with few qubits, facilitating the efficient

observe a quantum phase transition with spontaneous symmetry breaking and
reveal the evolution of entanglement properties across the critical point. For
the first time, we demonstrate log-law scaling of subsystem entanglement
entropies at criticality on a digital quantum computer. This achievement
highlights the potential of MERA for the investigation of strongly-correlated
many-body systems on quantum computers.

  Super-Resolution",,,,,eess.IV cs.CV,http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/,"  Implicit Neural Representation (INR) has been successfully employed for
Arbitrary-scale Super-Resolution (ASR). However, INR-based models need to query
the multi-layer perceptron module numerous times and render a pixel in each
query, resulting in insufficient representation capability and computational
efficiency. Recently, Gaussian Splatting (GS) has shown its advantages over INR
in both visual quality and rendering speed in 3D tasks, which motivates us to
explore whether GS can be employed for the ASR task. However, directly applying
GS to ASR is exceptionally challenging because the original GS is an
optimization-based method through overfitting each single scene, while in ASR
we aim to learn a single model that can generalize to different images and
scaling factors. We overcome these challenges by developing two novel
techniques. Firstly, to generalize GS for ASR, we elaborately design an
architecture to predict the corresponding image-conditioned Gaussians of the
input low-resolution image in a feed-forward manner. Each Gaussian can fit the
shape and direction of an area of complex textures, showing powerful
representation capability. Secondly, we implement an efficient differentiable
2D GPU/CUDA-based scale-aware rasterization to render super-resolved images by
sampling discrete RGB values from the predicted continuous Gaussians. Via
end-to-end training, our optimized network, namely GSASR, can perform ASR for
any image and unseen scaling factors. Extensive experiments validate the
effectiveness of our proposed method.

  conclusion, fixed some typos",,,,hep-ph cs.LG hep-ex stat.ML,http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/,"  The problem of interpretability of machine learning architecture in particle
physics has no agreed-upon definition, much less any proposed solution. We
present a first modest step toward these goals by proposing a definition and
corresponding practical method for isolation and identification of relevant
physical energy scales exploited by the machine. This is accomplished by
smearing or averaging over all input events that lie within a prescribed metric
energy distance of one another and correspondingly renders any quantity
measured on a finite, discrete dataset continuous over the dataspace. Within
this approach, we are able to explicitly demonstrate that (approximate) scaling
laws are a consequence of extreme value theory applied to analysis of the
distribution of the irreducible minimal distance over which a machine must
extrapolate given a finite dataset. As an example, we study quark versus gluon
jet identification, construct the smeared likelihood, and show that
discrimination power steadily increases as resolution decreases, indicating
that the true likelihood for the problem is sensitive to emissions at all
scales.

  convection in unstably stratified flows","39 pages, 11 figures",,,,physics.flu-dyn,http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/,"  This study proposes a global similarity correction for Reynolds-averaged
Navier--Stokes (RANS) modeling of buoyancy effects in unstably stratified
flows. Conventional two-equation RANS models (e.g., the $k$-$\varepsilon$
model) lack a clear criterion for incorporating unstable buoyancy effects in
their scale-determining equations (e.g., $\varepsilon$-equation). To address
this gap, a global correction function is introduced, derived from a
generalized algebraic formulation that incorporates available potential energy
as an additional parameter. This function reproduces a global similarity law
commonly observed in natural convection flows--for instance, the correlation
among the Nusselt, Rayleigh, and Prandtl numbers, which can be approximately
expressed as a single power law over a wide parameter range. A calibration
method is proposed in which an approximate analytical solution for
Rayleigh--B\'enard convection is obtained via equilibrium analysis, confirming
that the proposed model captures similarity relations not addressed by
conventional one-point closures. Numerical results show significantly improved
agreement with experimental data, accurately reproducing Nusselt number
dependencies over broad ranges of Rayleigh and Prandtl numbers in unstably
stratified flows, such as Rayleigh--B\'enard convection and two types of
internally heated convection. The method remains fully compatible with standard
RANS frameworks and reverts to traditional turbulence treatments in
shear-driven flows where buoyant effects are negligible. By introducing only a
single, simple, algebraic global function in the conventional
$\varepsilon$-equation, this approach significantly enhances the accuracy and
robustness of buoyancy-driven turbulence simulations.

high-quality images and videos, utilizing compressed latent representations to
reduce the computational burden of the diffusion process. While recent
advancements have primarily focused on scaling diffusion backbones and
improving autoencoder reconstruction quality, the interaction between these
components has received comparatively less attention. In this work, we perform
a spectral analysis of modern autoencoders and identify inordinate
high-frequency components in their latent spaces, which are especially
pronounced in the autoencoders with a large bottleneck channel size. We
hypothesize that this high-frequency component interferes with the
coarse-to-fine nature of the diffusion synthesis process and hinders the
generation quality. To mitigate the issue, we propose scale equivariance: a
simple regularization strategy that aligns latent and RGB spaces across
frequencies by enforcing scale equivariance in the decoder. It requires minimal
code changes and only up to 20K autoencoder fine-tuning steps, yet
significantly improves generation quality, reducing FID by 19% for image
generation on ImageNet-1K 256x256 and FVD by at least 44% for video generation

  based Co-constructive Approach",,,,,cs.AI math.OC,http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/,"  Since its inception, Fuzzy Set has been widely used to handle uncertainty and
imprecision in decision-making. However, conventional fuzzy sets, often
referred to as type-1 fuzzy sets (T1FSs) have limitations in capturing higher
levels of uncertainty, particularly when decision-makers (DMs) express
hesitation or ambiguity in membership degree. To address this, Interval Type-2
Fuzzy Sets (IT2FSs) have been introduced by incorporating uncertainty in
membership degree allocation, which enhanced flexibility in modelling
subjective judgments. Despite their advantages, existing IT2FS construction
methods often lack active involvement from DMs and that limits the
interpretability and effectiveness of decision models. This study proposes a
socio-technical co-constructive approach for developing IT2FS models of
linguistic terms by facilitating the active involvement of DMs in preference
elicitation and its application in multicriteria decision-making (MCDM)
problems. Our methodology is structured in two phases. The first phase involves
an interactive process between the DM and the decision analyst, in which a
modified version of Deck-of-Cards (DoC) method is proposed to construct T1FS
membership functions on a ratio scale. We then extend this method to
incorporate ambiguity in subjective judgment and that resulted in an IT2FS
model that better captures uncertainty in DM's linguistic assessments. The
second phase formalizes the constructed IT2FS model for application in MCDM by
defining an appropriate mathematical representation of such information,
aggregation rules, and an admissible ordering principle. The proposed framework
enhances the reliability and effectiveness of fuzzy decision-making not only by
accurately representing DM's personalized semantics of linguistic information.

distribution function (PDF) is strongly non-Gaussian and the length dependence

compare and contrast our results with recent theoretical predictions for

that active turbulence can arise, even in absence of orientational

tasks are now well-established, yet their effective deployment necessitates
careful hyperparameter optimization. Through extensive empirical studies
involving grid searches across diverse configurations, we discover universal
scaling laws governing these hyperparameters: optimal learning rate follows a
power-law relationship with both model parameters and data sizes, while optimal
batch size scales primarily with data sizes. Our analysis reveals a convex
optimization landscape for hyperparameters under fixed models and data size
conditions. This convexity implies an optimal hyperparameter plateau. We
contribute a universal, plug-and-play optimal hyperparameter tool for the
community. Its estimated values on the test set are merely 0.09% away from the
globally optimal LLM performance found via an exhaustive search. These laws
demonstrate remarkable robustness across variations in model sparsity, training
data distribution, and model shape. To our best known, this is the first work
that unifies different model shapes and structures, such as Mixture-of-Experts
models and dense transformers, as well as establishes optimal hyperparameter
scaling laws across diverse data distributions. This exhaustive optimization
process demands substantial computational resources, utilizing nearly one

Dadhichi et al., Phys. Rev. E 101, 052601 (2020). We show that in principle the
effect of lattice anisotropy should persist at large scales, leading to a
''mass'' for the angle field of the spins, and behaviour not in the
''Malthusian Toner-Tu'' universality class. Numerically, however, we find
power-law scaling of long-wavelength equal-time correlators in the
polar-ordered phase of our lattice model. The mass, if present, is very small.
Focussing on topological defects, we show numerically that defect interactions
are highly anisotropic with respect to the mean ordering direction. In
particular, the constituents of a $\pm 1$ pair are shielded from each other in
a class of configurations, deferring their annihilation and allowing time for
the nucleation of further defects. The result, we show numerically, is the
destruction of the polarised phase via an aster apocalypse reminiscent of that
found by Besse et al., Phys. Rev. Lett. 129, 268003 (2022), for the Malthusian
