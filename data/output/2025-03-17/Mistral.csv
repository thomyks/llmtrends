  Forecasting",AISTATS 2025,,,,cs.LG cs.AI cs.CL cs.CR,http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/,"  Large Language Models (LLMs) have recently demonstrated significant potential
in time series forecasting, offering impressive capabilities in handling
complex temporal data. However, their robustness and reliability in real-world
applications remain under-explored, particularly concerning their
susceptibility to adversarial attacks. In this paper, we introduce a targeted
adversarial attack framework for LLM-based time series forecasting. By
employing both gradient-free and black-box optimization methods, we generate
minimal yet highly effective perturbations that significantly degrade the
forecasting accuracy across multiple datasets and LLM architectures. Our
experiments, which include models like LLMTime with GPT-3.5, GPT-4, LLaMa, and
Mistral, TimeGPT, and TimeLLM show that adversarial attacks lead to much more
severe performance degradation than random noise, and demonstrate the broad
effectiveness of our attacks across different LLMs. The results underscore the
critical vulnerabilities of LLMs in time series forecasting, highlighting the
need for robust defense mechanisms to ensure their reliable deployment in
practical applications. The code repository can be found at
