  Models",,"Proceedings of the 2nd Conference on Learning for Dynamics and
  Control, in Proceedings of Machine Learning Research 120 (2020) pp. 55-64",,,stat.ME,http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/,"  Vector autoregressive (VAR) models are widely used for causal discovery and
forecasting in multivariate time series analysis. In the high-dimensional
setting, which is increasingly common in fields such as neuroscience and
econometrics, model parameters are inferred by L1-regularized maximum
likelihood (RML). A well-known feature of RML inference is that in general the
technique produces a trade-off between sparsity and bias that depends on the
choice of the regularization hyperparameter. In the context of multivariate
time series analysis, sparse estimates are favorable for causal discovery and
low-bias estimates are favorable for forecasting. However, owing to a paucity
of research on hyperparameter selection methods, practitioners must rely on
ad-hoc methods such as cross-validation (or manual tuning). The particular
balance that such approaches achieve between the two goals -- causal discovery
and forecasting -- is poorly understood. Our paper investigates this behavior
and proposes a method (UoI-VAR) that achieves a better balance between sparsity
and bias when the underlying causal influences are in fact sparse. We
demonstrate through simulation that RML with a hyperparameter selected by
cross-validation tends to overfit, producing relatively dense estimates. We
further demonstrate that UoI-VAR much more effectively approximates the correct
sparsity pattern with only a minor compromise in model fit, particularly so for
larger data dimensions, and that the estimates produced by UoI-VAR exhibit less
bias. We conclude that our method achieves improved performance especially
well-suited to applications involving simultaneous causal discovery and
forecasting in high-dimensional settings.

  between FedAvg and Local Training?",JMLR published version,,,,stat.ML cs.LG,http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/,"  A widely recognized difficulty in federated learning arises from the
statistical heterogeneity among clients: local datasets often originate from
distinct yet not entirely unrelated probability distributions, and
personalization is, therefore, necessary to achieve optimal results from each
individual's perspective. In this paper, we show how the excess risks of
personalized federated learning using a smooth, strongly convex loss depend on
data heterogeneity from a minimax point of view, with a focus on the FedAvg
algorithm (McMahan et al., 2017) and pure local training (i.e., clients solve
empirical risk minimization problems on their local datasets without any
communication). Our main result reveals an approximate alternative between
these two baseline algorithms for federated learning: the former algorithm is
minimax rate optimal over a collection of instances when data heterogeneity is
small, whereas the latter is minimax rate optimal when data heterogeneity is
large, and the threshold is sharp up to a constant.
  As an implication, our results show that from a worst-case point of view, a
dichotomous strategy that makes a choice between the two baseline algorithms is
rate-optimal. Another implication is that the popular FedAvg following by local
fine tuning strategy is also minimax optimal under additional regularity
conditions. Our analysis relies on a new notion of algorithmic stability that
takes into account the nature of federated learning.

  Adaptive Kernel","30 pages, 10 figures",,,,stat.ML cs.LG stat.CO,http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/,"  We propose a novel deterministic sampling method to approximate a target
distribution $\rho^*$ by minimizing the kernel discrepancy, also known as the
Maximum Mean Discrepancy (MMD). By employing the general \emph{energetic
variational inference} framework (Wang et al., 2021), we convert the problem of
minimizing MMD to solving a dynamic ODE system of the particles. We adopt the
implicit Euler numerical scheme to solve the ODE systems. This leads to a
proximal minimization problem in each iteration of updating the particles,
which can be solved by optimization algorithms such as L-BFGS. The proposed
method is named EVI-MMD. To overcome the long-existing issue of bandwidth
selection of the Gaussian kernel, we propose a novel way to specify the
bandwidth dynamically. Through comprehensive numerical studies, we have shown
the proposed adaptive bandwidth significantly improves the EVI-MMD. We use the
EVI-MMD algorithm to solve two types of sampling problems. In the first type,
the target distribution is given by a fully specified density function. The
second type is a ""two-sample problem"", where only training data are available.
The EVI-MMD method is used as a generative learning model to generate new
samples that follow the same distribution as the training data. With the
recommended settings of the tuning parameters, we show that the proposed
EVI-MMD method outperforms some existing methods for both types of problems.

expertise from developers. Nonetheless, this level of human capacity is not
sufficient considering the rapid evolution of new hardware architectures and
software environments. In light of this, recent research proposes adopting
machine learning and artificial intelligence techniques to automate the code
optimization process. In this paper, we introduce PerfRL, an innovative
framework designed to tackle the problem of code optimization. Our framework
leverages the capabilities of small language models (SLMs) and reinforcement
learning (RL), facilitating a system where SLMs can assimilate feedback from
their environment during the fine-tuning phase, notably through unit tests.
When benchmarked against existing models, PerfRL demonstrates superior
efficiency in terms of speed and computational resource usage, attributed to
its reduced need for training steps and its compatibility with SLMs.
Furthermore, it substantially diminishes the risk of logical and syntactical
errors. To evaluate our framework, we conduct experiments on the PIE dataset
using a lightweight large language model (i.e., CodeT5) and a new reinforcement
learning algorithm, namely RRHF. For evaluation purposes, we use a list of
evaluation metrics related to optimization quality and speedup. The evaluation
results show that our approach achieves similar or better results compared to
state-of-the-art models using shorter training times and smaller pre-trained

  Model Finetuning",,,,,cs.LG cs.AI cs.CL,http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/,"  Fine-tuning on task-specific datasets is a widely-embraced paradigm of
harnessing the powerful capability of pretrained LLMs for various downstream
tasks. Due to the popularity of LLMs fine-tuning and its accompanying privacy
concerns, differentially private (DP) fine-tuning of pretrained LLMs has been
widely used to safeguarding the privacy of task-specific datasets. Lying at the
design core of DP LLM fine-tuning methods is the satisfactory tradeoff among
privacy, utility, and scalability. Most existing methods build upon the seminal
work of DP-SGD. Despite pushing the scalability of DP-SGD to its limit,
DP-SGD-based fine-tuning methods are unfortunately limited by the inherent
inefficiency of SGD.
  In this paper, we investigate the potential of DP zeroth-order methods for
LLM pretraining, which avoids the scalability bottleneck of SGD by
approximating the gradient with the more efficient zeroth-order gradient.
Rather than treating the zeroth-order method as a drop-in replacement for SGD,
this paper presents a comprehensive study both theoretically and empirically.
First, we propose the stagewise DP zeroth-order method (DP-ZOSO) that
dynamically schedules key hyperparameters. This design is grounded on the
synergy between DP random perturbation and the gradient approximation error of
the zeroth-order method, and its effect on fine-tuning trajectory.
  We provide theoretical analysis for both proposed methods. We conduct
extensive empirical analysis on both encoder-only masked language model and
decoder-only autoregressive language model, achieving impressive results in
terms of scalability and utility regardless of the class of tasks (compared
with DPZero, DP-ZOPO improves $4.5\%$ on SST-5, $5.5\%$ on MNLI with
RoBERTa-Large and 9.2\% on CB, 3.9\% on BoolQ with OPT-2.7b when $\epsilon=4$,
demonstrates more significant enhancement in performance on more complicated
tasks).

efficient alternative to reinforcement learning from human feedback (RLHF). In
this paper, we propose a novel and enhanced version of DPO based on curriculum

stages. First, a ranking of the examples generated for each prompt is obtained
by employing a reward model. Then, increasingly difficult pairs of examples are
sampled and provided to a text-to-image generative (diffusion or consistency)
model. Generated samples that are far apart in the ranking are considered to
form easy pairs, while those that are close in the ranking form hard pairs. In
other words, we use the rank difference between samples as a measure of
difficulty. The sampled pairs are split into batches according to their
difficulty levels, which are gradually used to train the generative model. Our
approach, Curriculum DPO, is compared against state-of-the-art fine-tuning

images of given concepts by fine-tuning diffusion models on a few examples.
However, tuning-based methods inherently tend to overfit the concepts,
resulting in failure to create the concept under multiple conditions (*e.g.*,
headphone is missing when generating ""a `dog wearing a headphone"").
Interestingly, we notice that the base model before fine-tuning exhibits the
capability to compose the base concept with other elements (*e.g.*, ""a dog
wearing a headphone""), implying that the compositional ability only disappears
after personalization tuning. We observe a semantic shift in the customized
concept after fine-tuning, indicating that the personalized concept is not
aligned with the original concept, and further show through theoretical
analyses that this semantic shift leads to increased difficulty in sampling the
joint conditional probability distribution, resulting in the loss of the
compositional ability. Inspired by this finding, we present **ClassDiffusion**,
a technique that leverages a **semantic preservation loss** to explicitly
regulate the concept space when learning a new concept. Although simple, this
approach effectively prevents semantic drift during the fine-tuning process of
the target concepts. Extensive qualitative and quantitative experiments
demonstrate that the use of semantic preservation loss effectively improves the
compositional abilities of fine-tuning models. Lastly, we also extend our
ClassDiffusion to personalized video generation, demonstrating its flexibility.

growing memory demands of Key-Value (KV) cache, especially for longer
sequences. Traditional KV cache eviction strategies, which discard less
critical KV pairs based on attention scores, often degrade generation quality,
leading to issues such as context loss or hallucinations. In this work, we
introduce Dynamic Discriminative Operations (D2O), a KV cache compression
method that optimizes KV cache size dynamically and discriminatively at two
levels without fine-tuning, while preserving essential context. At layer level,
D2O leverages the varying densities of attention weights between shallow and
deep layers to dynamically determine which layers should avoid excessive
eviction via a novel dynamic allocation strategy to minimize information loss.
At token level, D2O incorporates a compensation mechanism that maintains a
similarity threshold to re-discriminate the importance of currently discarded
tokens, determining whether they should be recalled and merged with similar
tokens. We conduct experiments on various benchmarks and LLM architectures. Our
results show that D2O not only achieves significant memory savings and enhances
inference throughput by more than 3$\times$ but also maintains high-quality

such as weather forecasting, but challenging due to the characteristic
sensitive dependence on initial conditions. Traditional modeling approaches
require extensive domain knowledge, often leading to a shift towards
data-driven methods using machine learning. However, existing research provides
inconclusive results on which machine learning methods are best suited for
predicting chaotic systems. In this paper, we compare different lightweight and
heavyweight machine learning architectures using extensive existing benchmark
databases, as well as a newly introduced database that allows for uncertainty
quantification in the benchmark results. In addition to state-of-the-art
methods from the literature, we also present new advantageous variants of
established methods. Hyperparameter tuning is adjusted based on computational
cost, with more tuning allocated to less costly methods. Furthermore, we
introduce the cumulative maximum error, a novel metric that combines desirable
properties of traditional metrics and is tailored for chaotic systems. Our
results show that well-tuned simple methods, as well as untuned baseline
methods, often outperform state-of-the-art deep learning models, but their
performance can vary significantly with different experimental setups. These
findings highlight the importance of aligning prediction methods with data
characteristics and caution against the indiscriminate use of overly complex
models.

Segment Anything Model 2 (SAM2) framework has shown superior advancements in
image and video segmentation. However, SAM2 struggles with efficiency due to
the high computational demands of processing high-resolution images and complex

challenges, we introduce Surgical SAM 2 (SurgSAM2), an advanced model to
utilize SAM2 with an Efficient Frame Pruning (EFP) mechanism, to facilitate
real-time surgical video segmentation. The EFP mechanism dynamically manages
the memory bank by selectively retaining only the most informative frames,
reducing memory usage and computational cost while maintaining high
segmentation accuracy. Our extensive experiments demonstrate that SurgSAM2
significantly improves both efficiency and segmentation accuracy compared to
the vanilla SAM2. Remarkably, SurgSAM2 achieves a 3$\times$ FPS compared with
SAM2, while also delivering state-of-the-art performance after fine-tuning with
lower-resolution data. These advancements establish SurgSAM2 as a leading model
for surgical video analysis, making real-time surgical video segmentation in

like CLIP as a backbone. These methods process each sampled frame independently
by the image encoder, resulting in high computational overhead and limiting
practical deployment. Addressing this, we focus on efficient text-video
retrieval by tackling two key challenges: 1. From the perspective of trainable
parameters, current parameter-efficient fine-tuning methods incur high
inference costs; 2. From the perspective of model complexity, current token
compression methods are mainly designed for images to reduce spatial redundancy
but overlook temporal redundancy in consecutive frames of a video. To tackle
these challenges, we propose Temporal Token Merging (TempMe), a
parameter-efficient and training-inference efficient text-video retrieval
architecture that minimizes trainable parameters and model complexity.
Specifically, we introduce a progressive multi-granularity framework. By
gradually combining neighboring clips, we reduce spatio-temporal redundancy and
enhance temporal modeling across different frames, leading to improved
efficiency and performance. Extensive experiments validate the superiority of
our TempMe. Compared to previous parameter-efficient text-video retrieval
methods, TempMe achieves superior performance with just 0.50M trainable
parameters. It significantly reduces output tokens by 95% and GFLOPs by 51%,
while achieving a 1.8X speedup and a 4.4% R-Sum improvement. With full

logical errors and hallucinations in long-horizon planning, unless provided
with highly relevant examples to the tasks. However, providing highly relevant
examples for any random task is unpractical. Therefore, we present ReLEP, a
novel framework for Real-time Long-horizon Embodied Planning. ReLEP can
complete a wide range of long-horizon tasks without in-context examples by
learning implicit logical inference through fine-tuning. The fine-tuned large
vision-language model formulates plans as sequences of skill functions. These
functions are selected from a carefully designed skill library. ReLEP is also
equipped with a Memory module for plan and status recall, and a Robot
Configuration module for versatility across robot types. In addition, we
propose a data generation pipeline to tackle dataset scarcity. When
constructing the dataset, we considered the implicit logical relationships,
enabling the model to learn implicit logical relationships and dispel
hallucinations. Through comprehensive evaluations across various long-horizon

mechanisms: (1) Feedback-Aligned Representation Learning, an online training
method that captures human feedback and provides informative learning signals
for fine-tuning, and (2) Feedback-Guided Image Generation, which involves
generating images from SD's refined initialization samples, enabling faster
convergence towards the evaluator's intent. We demonstrate that HERO is 4x more

solve complex problems by recursively generating intermediate states, analogous
to fine-tuning for chain-of-thought (CoT) reasoning. We consider training a
one-layer transformer to solve the fundamental $k$-parity problem, extending
the work on RNNs by Wies et al. (2023). We establish three key results: (1) any
finite-precision gradient-based algorithm, without intermediate supervision,
requires substantial iterations to solve parity with finite samples. (2) In
contrast, when intermediate parities are incorporated into the loss function,
our model can learn parity in one gradient update when aided by \emph{teacher
forcing}, where ground-truth labels of the reasoning chain are provided at each
generation step. (3) Even without teacher forcing, where the model must
generate CoT chains end-to-end, parity can be learned efficiently if augmented
data is employed to internally verify the soundness of intermediate steps. Our
findings, supported by numerical experiments, show that task decomposition and
stepwise reasoning naturally arise from optimizing transformers with CoT;
moreover, self-consistency checking can improve multi-step reasoning ability,
aligning with empirical studies of CoT.

recent advancements have proposed the use of Direct Preference Optimization
(DPO) to suppress output of dispreferred responses, thereby enhancing the
long-chain reasoning capabilities of large language models (LLMs). To this end,
these studies employed LLMs to generate preference trees via Tree-of-thoughts
(ToT) and sample the paired preference responses required by the DPO algorithm.
However, the DPO algorithm based on binary preference optimization is unable to
learn multiple responses with varying degrees of preference/dispreference that
provided by the preference trees, resulting in incomplete preference learning.
In this work, we introduce Tree Preference Optimization (TPO), that does not
sample paired preference responses from the preference tree; instead, it
directly learns from the entire preference tree during the fine-tuning.
Specifically, TPO formulates the language model alignment as a Preference List
Ranking problem, where the policy can potentially learn more effectively from a
ranked preference list of responses given the prompt. In addition, to further
assist LLMs in identifying discriminative steps within long-chain reasoning and
increase the relative reward margin in the preference list, TPO utilizes
Adaptive Step Reward to adjust the reward values of each step in trajectory for
performing fine-grained preference optimization. We carry out extensive
experiments on mathematical reasoning tasks to evaluate TPO. The experimental
results indicate that TPO consistently outperforms DPO across five public large
language models on four datasets.

inconsistent hyperparameter tuning. Although models such as Support Vector

charge rearrangement or impurity-induced interruptions. Our investigations in
the electron transport regime have explored phenomena such as Coulomb blockade
effect, Zeeman effect,and Kondo effect. Meanwhile, in the hole-transport
regime, we have identified conductance peaks induced by lead states.
Particularly, we have created a tomographic analysis method of these lead
states by tracking the behavior of these conductance peaks across consecutive
Coulomb diamond structures.

natural phenomena, making their solution crucial in science and engineering.
While traditional methods, such as the finite element method, provide reliable
solutions, their accuracy is often tied to the use of computationally intensive
fine meshes. Moreover, they do not naturally account for measurements or prior
solutions, and any change in the problem parameters requires results to be
fully recomputed. Neural network-based approaches, such as physics-informed
neural networks and neural operators, offer a mesh-free alternative by directly
fitting those models to the PDE solution. They can also integrate prior
knowledge and tackle entire families of PDEs by simply aggregating additional
training losses. Nevertheless, they are highly sensitive to hyperparameters
such as collocation points and the weights associated with each loss. This
paper addresses these challenges by developing a science-constrained learning
(SCL) framework. It demonstrates that finding a (weak) solution of a PDE is
equivalent to solving a constrained learning problem with worst-case losses.
This explains the limitations of previous methods that minimize the expected
value of aggregated losses. SCL also organically integrates structural
constraints (e.g., invariances) and (partial) measurements or known solutions.
The resulting constrained learning problems can be tackled using a practical
algorithm that yields accurate solutions across a variety of PDEs, neural
network architectures, and prior knowledge levels without extensive
hyperparameter tuning and sometimes even at a lower computational cost.

  Access",,,,,eess.IV cs.AI cs.CV cs.LG,http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-nd/4.0/,"  Physics-driven deep learning (PD-DL) approaches have become popular for
improved reconstruction of fast magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scans. Though
PD-DL offers higher acceleration rates than existing clinical fast MRI
techniques, their use has been limited outside specialized MRI centers. A key
challenge is generalization to underrepresented pathologies or populations,
noted in multiple studies, with fine-tuning on target populations suggested for
improvement. However, current approaches for PD-DL training require access to
raw k-space measurements, which is typically only available at specialized MRI
centers that have research agreements for such data access. This is especially
an issue for rural and underserved areas, where commercial MRI scanners only
provide access to a final reconstructed image. To tackle these challenges, we
propose Compressibility-inspired Unsupervised Learning via Parallel Imaging
Fidelity (CUPID) for high-quality PD-DL training using only routine clinical
reconstructed images exported from an MRI scanner. CUPID evaluates output
quality with a compressibility-based approach while ensuring that the output
stays consistent with the clinical parallel imaging reconstruction through
well-designed perturbations. Our results show CUPID achieves similar quality to
established PD-DL training that requires k-space data while outperforming
compressed sensing (CS) and diffusion-based generative methods. We further
demonstrate its effectiveness in a zero-shot training setup for retrospectively
and prospectively sub-sampled acquisitions, attesting to its minimal training
burden. As an approach that radically deviates from existing strategies, CUPID
presents an opportunity to provide equitable access to fast MRI for underserved
populations in an attempt to reduce the inequalities associated with this
expensive imaging modality.

  Commits Using LLM Heuristics",,,,,cs.SE cs.CR,http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/,"  Accurate identification of software vulnerabilities is crucial for system
integrity. Vulnerability datasets, often derived from the National
Vulnerability Database (NVD) or directly from GitHub, are essential for
training machine learning models to detect these security flaws. However, these
datasets frequently suffer from significant noise, typically 40% to 75%, due
primarily to the automatic and indiscriminate labeling of all changes in
vulnerability-fixing commits (VFCs) as vulnerability-related. This
misclassification occurs because not all changes in a commit aimed at fixing
vulnerabilities pertain to security threats; many are routine updates like bug
fixes or test improvements.
  This paper introduces the first methodology that uses the Large Language
Model (LLM) with a heuristic enhancement to automatically identify
vulnerability-fixing changes from VFCs, achieving an F1-score of 0.82.
VulSifter was applied to a large-scale study, where we conducted a crawl of
127,063 repositories on GitHub, resulting in the acquisition of 5,352,105
commits. VulSifter involves utilizing an LLM to comprehend code semantics and
contextual information, while applying heuristics to filter out unrelated
changes. We then developed CleanVul, a high-quality dataset comprising 8,203
functions using our LLM heuristic enhancement approach, demonstrating
Correctness (90.6%) comparable to established datasets such as SVEN and
PrimeVul.
  To evaluate the CleanVul dataset, we conducted experiments focusing on
fine-tuning various LLMs on CleanVul and other high-quality datasets.
Evaluation results reveal that LLMs fine-tuned on CleanVul not only exhibit
enhanced accuracy but also superior generalization capabilities compared to
those trained on uncleaned datasets. Specifically, models trained on CleanVul
and tested on PrimeVul achieve accuracy higher than those trained and tested
exclusively on PrimeVul.

trajectory forecasting: pedestrian perception errors, real-world data
collection costs, and person ID annotation costs. We propose a novel framework,
RealTraj, that enhances the real-world applicability of trajectory forecasting.
Our approach includes two training phases -- self-supervised pretraining on
synthetic data and weakly-supervised fine-tuning with limited real-world data
-- to minimize data collection efforts. To improve robustness to real-world
errors, we focus on both model design and training objectives. Specifically, we
present Det2TrajFormer, a trajectory forecasting model that remains invariant
to tracking noise by using past detections as inputs. Additionally, we pretrain
the model using multiple pretext tasks, which enhance robustness and improve
forecasting performance based solely on detection data. Unlike previous
trajectory forecasting methods, our approach fine-tunes the model using only
ground-truth detections, reducing the need for costly person ID annotations. In
the experiments, we comprehensively verify the effectiveness of the proposed
method against the limitations, and the method outperforms state-of-the-art
trajectory forecasting methods on multiple datasets. The code will be released

demands substantial memory resources, primarily due to the storage of optimizer
states. While LoRA, a popular parameter-efficient method, reduces memory usage,
it often suffers from suboptimal performance due to the constraints of low-rank
updates. Low-rank gradient projection methods (e.g., GaLore, Flora) reduce
optimizer memory by projecting gradients and moment estimates into low-rank
spaces via singular value decomposition or random projection. However, they
fail to account for inter-projection correlation, causing performance
degradation, and their projection strategies often incur high computational
costs. In this paper, we present COAP (Correlation-Aware Gradient Projection),
a memory-efficient method that minimizes computational overhead while
maintaining training performance. Evaluated across various vision, language,
and multimodal tasks, COAP outperforms existing methods in both training speed
and model performance. For LLaMA-1B, it reduces optimizer memory by 61% with
only 2% additional time cost, achieving the same PPL as AdamW. With 8-bit

To implement TC-FT and SCA effectively, we incorporated HTML-render into the

high-fidelity identity in portrait generation. This is challenging due to the
mutual interference between expression and identity: (i) fine expression
control signals inevitably introduce appearance-related semantics (e.g., facial
contours, and ratio), which impact the identity of the generated portrait; (ii)
even coarse-grained expression control can cause facial changes that compromise
identity, since they all act on the face. These limitations remain unaddressed
by previous generation methods, which primarily rely on coarse control signals
or two-stage inference that integrates portrait animation. Here, we introduce
EmojiDiff, the first end-to-end solution that enables simultaneous control of
extremely detailed expression (RGB-level) and high-fidelity identity in
portrait generation. To address the above challenges, EmojiDiff adopts a
two-stage scheme involving decoupled training and fine-tuning. For decoupled
training, we innovate ID-irrelevant Data Iteration (IDI) to synthesize
cross-identity expression pairs by dividing and optimizing the processes of
maintaining expression and altering identity, thereby ensuring stable and

disentangle fine expression features in the expression template from other
extraneous information (e.g., identity, skin). Subsequently, we present
ID-enhanced Contrast Alignment (ICA) for further fine-tuning. ICA achieves
rapid reconstruction and joint supervision of identity and expression
information, thus aligning identity representations of images with and without

outperforms counterparts, achieves precise expression control with highly

high-dimensional robust regression with serially correlated errors and
predictors. The proposed framework employs a novel scaled pseudo-Huber (SPH)
loss function, which smooths the well-known Huber loss, effectively balancing
quadratic ($\ell_2$) and absolute linear ($\ell_1$) loss behaviors. This
flexibility enables the framework to accommodate both thin-tailed and
heavy-tailed data efficiently. The generalized Bayesian approach constructs a
working likelihood based on the SPH loss, facilitating efficient and stable
estimation while providing rigorous uncertainty quantification for all model
parameters. Notably, this approach allows formal statistical inference without
requiring ad hoc tuning parameter selection while adaptively addressing a wide
range of tail behavior in the errors. By specifying appropriate prior
distributions for the regression coefficients--such as ridge priors for small
or moderate-dimensional settings and spike-and-slab priors for high-dimensional
settings--the framework ensures principled inference. We establish rigorous
theoretical guarantees for accurate parameter estimation and correct predictor
selection under sparsity assumptions for a wide range of data generating
setups. Extensive simulation studies demonstrate the superior performance of
our approach compared to traditional Bayesian regression methods based on
$\ell_2$ and $\ell_1$-loss functions. The results highlight its flexibility and

  Vision-Language Models",,,,,cs.CV cs.AI,http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/,"  Physical reasoning, which involves interpreting object behaviors within
dynamic environments, remains a significant challenge for Vision-Language
Models (VLMs). The limitations in physical reasoning arise from an inability to
translate learned knowledge into predictions about physical behavior. We
perform a careful study to show how continual fine-tuning can mitigate this
issue. However, fine-tuning is expensive for large models and impractical to
repeatedly perform for every task. This necessitates the creation of modular
and scalable ways to teach VLMs about physical reasoning. To that end, we
introduce Physics Context Builders (PCBs), a novel modular framework where
specialized VLMs are fine-tuned to generate detailed physical scene
descriptions. These can be used as physical contexts for larger VLMs to enhance
their reasoning capabilities. PCBs enable the separation of visual perception
from reasoning, allowing us to analyze their relative contributions to physical
understanding. We perform careful experiments on CLEVRER and on Falling Tower,
a stability detection dataset with both simulated and real-world scenes, to
demonstrate that PCBs provide substantial performance improvements, increasing
average accuracy by up to 13.8% on complex physical reasoning tasks. Notably,
PCBs show strong Sim2Real transfer, successfully generalizing from simulated
training data to real-world scenes. Our work demonstrates that enhancing visual
perception through modular, simulation-trained components offers a practical
approach to improving physical reasoning in VLMs, while providing insights into
the factors affecting physical understanding in these models.

between mask generators and vision-language models like Contrastive
Language-Image Pre-training (CLIP). Previous approaches focus on generating
masks while aligning mask features with text embeddings during training. In
this paper, we observe that relying on generated low-quality masks can weaken
the alignment of vision and language in regional representations. This
motivates us to present a new fine-tuning framework, named MaskCLIP++, which
uses ground-truth masks instead of generated masks to enhance the mask
classification capability of CLIP. Due to the limited diversity of image
segmentation datasets with mask annotations, we propose incorporating a
consistency alignment principle during fine-tuning, which alleviates
categorical bias toward the fine-tuning dataset. After low-cost fine-tuning,
MaskCLIP++ significantly improves the mask classification performance on
multi-domain datasets. Combining with the mask generator in previous
state-of-the-art mask-based open vocabulary segmentation methods, we achieve
performance improvements of +1.7, +2.3, +2.1, +3.1, and +0.3 mIoU on the A-847,
PC-459, A-150, PC-59, and PAS-20 datasets, respectively. Code is avaliable at

denoising steps, and feature types. Our AsymRnR asymmetrically reduces
redundant tokens in the attention operation, achieving acceleration with
negligible degradation in output quality and, in some cases, even improving it.
We also tailored a reduction schedule to distribute the reduction across
components adaptively. To further accelerate this process, we introduce a

fixed number of lower-level iterations, and requires extensive tuning. In this
work, we focus on bilevel learning with strongly convex lower-level problems
and a nonconvex sum-of-functions in the upper-level. Stochasticity arises from
data sampling in the upper-level which leads to inexact stochastic
hypergradients. We establish their connection to state-of-the-art stochastic
optimization theory for nonconvex objectives. Furthermore, we prove the
convergence of inexact stochastic bilevel optimization under mild assumptions.
Our empirical results highlight significant speed-ups and improved

First, limited datasets constrain the performance and effectiveness of models.
Second, previous studies have primarily focused on generating FFA for single

with various ophthalmic conditions. To address these issues, we propose a novel
latent diffusion model-based framework, Diffusion, which introduces a
fine-tuning protocol to overcome the challenge of limited medical data and
unleash the generative capabilities of diffusion models. Furthermore, we
designed a new approach to tackle the challenges of generating across different

model editing, particularly to comply with evolving data regulations like the

a novel input perturbation-based perspective, where the model weights remain
intact throughout the unlearning process. We demonstrate the existence of a
proactive input-based unlearning strategy, referred to forget vector, which can
be generated as an input-agnostic data perturbation and remains as effective as
model-based approximate unlearning approaches. We also explore forget vector
arithmetic, whereby multiple class-specific forget vectors are combined through
simple operations (e.g., linear combinations) to generate new forget vectors
for unseen unlearning tasks, such as forgetting arbitrary subsets across
classes. Extensive experiments validate the effectiveness and adaptability of
the forget vector, showcasing its competitive performance relative to

vision-language model (e.g., LLaVA) and the downstream task-specific model
(e.g., SAM). However, we observe that little research has looked into how it
works.In this work, we first visualize the similarity maps, which are obtained
by computing the semantic similarity between the $\texttt{<SEG>}$ token and the
image token embeddings derived from the last hidden layer in both the LLaVA
encoder and SAM decoder. Intriguingly, we have found that a striking
consistency holds in terms of activation responses in the similarity map, which
reveals that what the $\texttt{<SEG>}$ token contributes to is semantic
similarity within image-text pairs. Specifically, the $\texttt{<SEG>}$ token, a
placeholder expanded in text vocabulary, extensively queries among individual
tokenized image patches to match the semantics of an object from text to the
paired image, while the Large Language Models (LLMs) are being fine-tuned. Upon
the above findings, we present READ, which facilitates LMMs' resilient
$\textbf{REA}$soning capability of where to atten$\textbf{D}$ under the
guidance of highly activated points borrowed from similarity maps. Remarkably,
READ features an intuitive design, Similarity as Points module (SasP), which
can be seamlessly applied to $\texttt{<SEG>}$-like paradigms in a plug-and-play
fashion. Also, extensive experiments have been conducted on ReasonSeg and
RefCOCO(+/g) datasets. To validate whether READ suffers from catastrophic
forgetting of previous skills after fine-tuning, we further assess its
generation ability on an augmented FP-RefCOCO(+/g) dataset. All codes and

and reliability. This evaluation tests eleven different open source LLMs with
sizes ranging from 1-70 billion model parameters on three basic tasks of the

codes, and extracting the date of first diagnosis. For evaluating the LLMs on
these tasks, a dataset of annotated text snippets based on anonymized doctors'
notes from urology was prepared. Different prompting strategies were used to
investigate the effect of the number of examples in few-shot prompting and to
explore the capabilities of the LLMs in general. The models Llama 3.1 8B,
Mistral 7B, and Mistral NeMo 12 B performed comparably well in the tasks.
Models with less extensive training data or having fewer than 7 billion
parameters showed notably lower performance, while larger models did not
display performance gains. Examples from a different medical domain than
urology could also improve the outcome in few-shot prompting, which
demonstrates the ability of LLMs to handle tasks needed for tumor
documentation. Open source LLMs show a strong potential for automating tumor
documentation. Models from 7-12 billion parameters could offer an optimal
balance between performance and resource efficiency. With tailored fine-tuning
and well-designed prompting, these models might become important tools for
clinical documentation in the future. The code for the evaluation is available

often arise. To obtain safety guarantees, many existing safe Bayesian
optimization methods rely on assumptions that are hard to verify in practice.
This leads to the use of unjustified heuristics in many applications, which
invalidates the theoretical safety guarantees. Furthermore, applications often
require multiple safety constraints to be satisfied simultaneously. Building on
recently proposed Lipschitz-only safe Bayesian optimization, we develop an
algorithm that relies on readily interpretable assumptions and satisfies
multiple safety constraints at the same time. We apply this algorithm to the
problem of automatically tuning a trajectory-tracking controller of a
self-driving car. Results both from simulations and an actual test vehicle
underline the algorithm's ability to learn tracking controllers without leaving

fine-tuning. Furthermore, we incorporate a prior-guided fusion (PGF) module and
a score-aware sampling strategy to efficiently fuse pose and RGB information,
addressing keypoint inaccuracies and improving computational efficiency.

and velocity of a vehicle operating in three-dimensional (3D) space with six
degrees of freedom (6-DoF). A Deep Learning-based Adaptation Mechanism (DLAM)
is proposed to adaptively tune the noise covariance matrices of Kalman-type
filters for the Visual-Inertial Navigation (VIN) problem, leveraging
IMU-Vision-Net. Subsequently, an adaptively tuned Deep Learning Unscented
Kalman Filter for 3D VIN (DeepUKF-VIN) is introduced to utilize the proposed
DLAM, thereby robustly estimating key navigation components, including
orientation, position, and linear velocity. The proposed DeepUKF-VIN integrates
data from onboard sensors, specifically an inertial measurement unit (IMU) and
visual feature points extracted from a camera, and is applicable for GPS-denied
navigation. Its quaternion-based design effectively captures navigation
nonlinearities and avoids the singularities commonly encountered with
Euler-angle-based filters. Implemented in discrete space, the DeepUKF-VIN
facilitates practical filter deployment. The filter's performance is evaluated
using real-world data collected from an IMU and a stereo camera at low sampling
rates. The results demonstrate filter stability and rapid attenuation of
estimation errors, highlighting its high estimation accuracy. Furthermore,
comparative testing against the standard Unscented Kalman Filter (UKF) in two
scenarios consistently shows superior performance across all navigation
components, thereby validating the efficacy and robustness of the proposed
DeepUKF-VIN. Keywords: Deep Learning, Unscented Kalman Filter, Adaptive tuning,

reducing the number of trainable parameters and memory requirements of large
transformer networks while maintaining fine-tuning performance. The low-rank
nature of the weight update inherently limits the representation power of
fine-tuned models, however, thus potentially compromising performance on
complex tasks. This raises a critical question: when a performance gap between
LoRA and standard fine-tuning is observed, is it due to the reduced number of
trainable parameters or the rank deficiency? This paper aims to answer this
question by introducing RandLoRA, a parameter-efficient method that performs
full-rank updates using a learned linear combinations of low-rank,
non-trainable random matrices. Our method limits the number of trainable
parameters by restricting optimization to diagonal scaling matrices applied to
the fixed random matrices. This allows us to effectively overcome the low-rank
limitations while maintaining parameter and memory efficiency during training.
Through extensive experimentation across vision, language, and vision-language
benchmarks, we systematically evaluate the limitations of LoRA and existing
random basis methods. Our findings reveal that full-rank updates are beneficial
across vision and language tasks individually, and even more so for
vision-language tasks, where RandLoRA significantly reduces -- and sometimes
eliminates -- the performance gap between standard fine-tuning and LoRA,
demonstrating its efficacy.

segmentation: (1) Most existing works are restricted to one modality, i.e, the
Color Fundus (CF). However, multi-modality retinal images are used every day in
the study of retina and retinal diseases, and the study of vessel segmentation
on the other modalities is scarce; (2) Even though a small amount of works
extended their experiments to limited new modalities such as the Multi-Color
Scanning Laser Ophthalmoscopy (MC), these works still require finetuning a
separate model for the new modality. The finetuning will require extra training
data, which is difficult to acquire. In this work, we present a foundational
universal vessel segmentation model (UVSM) for multi-modality retinal images.
Not only do we perform the study on a much wider range of modalities, but we
also propose a universal model to segment the vessels in all these
commonly-used modalities. Despite being much more versatile comparing with
existing methods, our universal model still demonstrates comparable performance
with the state-of-the-art finetuned methods. To the best of our knowledge, this
is the first work that achieves cross-modality retinal vessel segmentation and
also the first work to study retinal vessel segmentation in some novel

shown that KL-regularization plays a pivotal role in improving the efficiency
of RL fine-tuning for large language models (LLMs). Despite its empirical
advantage, the theoretical difference between KL-regularized RL and standard RL
remains largely under-explored. While there is a recent line of work on the
theoretical analysis of KL-regularized objective in decision making
\citep{xiong2024iterative, xie2024exploratory,zhao2024sharp}, these analyses
either reduce to the traditional RL setting or rely on strong coverage
assumptions. In this paper, we propose an optimism-based KL-regularized online
contextual bandit algorithm, and provide a novel analysis of its regret. By
carefully leveraging the benign optimization landscape induced by the
KL-regularization and the optimistic reward estimation, our algorithm achieves
an $\mathcal{O}\big(\eta\log (N_{\mathcal R} T)\cdot d_{\mathcal R}\big)$
logarithmic regret bound, where $\eta, N_{\mathcal R},T,d_{\mathcal R}$ denote
the KL-regularization parameter, the cardinality of the reward function class,
number of rounds, and the complexity of the reward function class. Furthermore,
we extend our algorithm and analysis to reinforcement learning by developing a
novel decomposition over transition steps and also obtain a similar logarithmic
regret bound.

capabilities like object counting or length comparison, which are essential for
relevant complex tasks like chart understanding and geometric reasoning. In
this work, we first investigate the root causes of this deficiency through a
suite of probing tasks focusing on basic visual arithmetic. Our analysis
reveals that while pre-trained vision encoders typically capture sufficient
information, the text decoder often fails to decode it correctly for arithmetic
reasoning. To address this, we propose CogAlign, a novel post-training strategy
inspired by Piaget's theory of cognitive development. CogAlign trains VLMs to
recognize invariant properties under visual transformations. We demonstrate
that this approach significantly improves the performance of three diverse VLMs
on our proposed probing tasks. Furthermore, CogAlign enhances performance by an
average of 4.6% on CHOCOLATE and 2.9% on MATH-VISION, outperforming or matching
supervised fine-tuning methods while requiring only 60% less training data.
These results highlight the effectiveness and generalizability of CogAlign in
improving fundamental visual arithmetic capabilities and their transfer to
downstream tasks.

test whether they were trained independently -- i.e., from independent random
initializations? We consider two settings: constrained and unconstrained. In
the constrained setting, we make assumptions about model architecture and
training and propose a family of statistical tests that yield exact p-values
with respect to the null hypothesis that the models are trained from
independent random initializations. These p-values are valid regardless of the
composition of either model's training data; we compute them by simulating
exchangeable copies of each model under our assumptions and comparing various
similarity measures of weights and activations between the original two models
versus these copies. We report the p-values from these tests on pairs of 21
open-weight models (210 total pairs) and correctly identify all pairs of
non-independent models. Our tests remain effective even if one model was
fine-tuned for many tokens. In the unconstrained setting, where we make no
assumptions about training procedures, can change model architecture, and allow
for adversarial evasion attacks, the previous tests no longer work. Instead, we
propose a new test which matches hidden activations between two models, and
which is robust to adversarial transformations and to changes in model
architecture. The test can also do localized testing: identifying specific
non-independent components of models. Though we no longer obtain exact p-values
from this, empirically we find it behaves as one and reliably identifies
non-independent models. Notably, we can use the test to identify specific parts
of one model that are derived from another (e.g., how Llama 3.1-8B was pruned
to initialize Llama 3.2-3B, or shared layers between Mistral-7B and
StripedHyena-7B), and it is even robust to retraining individual layers of

unfaithfulness in such settings, we propose using computationally light
auxiliary models to rescore the outputs of larger architectures. As proof of
the feasibility of such an approach, we show that monolingual 4-layer BERT
models pretrained from scratch on less than 700 MB of data without fine-tuning
are able to identify faithful summaries with a mean accuracy of 88.33% in three
genetically unrelated languages that differ in their morphological complexity -
Vietnamese, Polish and Georgian. The same hyperparameter combination moreover
generalises well to three other tasks, suggesting applications for rescoring
beyond improving faithfulness. In order to inform typologically aware model
selection, we also investigate how morphological complexity interacts with
regularisation, model depth and training objectives, ultimately demonstrating
that morphologically complex languages are more likely to benefit from dropout,
while across languages downstream performance is enhanced most by shallow
architectures as well as training using the standard BERT objectives.

  Dongsuk Jeon",PaCA: Partial Connection Adaptation for Efficient Fine-Tuning,,,,,cs.LG cs.AI,http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-sa/4.0/,"  Prior parameter-efficient fine-tuning (PEFT) algorithms reduce memory usage
and computational costs of fine-tuning large neural network models by training
only a few additional adapter parameters, rather than the entire model.
However, the reduction in computational costs due to PEFT does not necessarily
translate to a reduction in training time; although the computational costs of
the adapter layers are much smaller than the pretrained layers, it is well
known that those two types of layers are processed sequentially on GPUs,
resulting in significant latency overhead. LoRA and its variants merge low-rank
adapter matrices with pretrained weights during inference to avoid latency
overhead, but during training, the pretrained weights remain frozen while the
adapter matrices are continuously updated, preventing such merging. To mitigate
this issue, we propose Partial Connection Adaptation (PaCA), which fine-tunes
randomly selected partial connections within the pretrained weights instead of
introducing adapter layers in the model. PaCA not only enhances training speed
by eliminating the time overhead due to the sequential processing of the
adapter and pretrained layers but also reduces activation memory since only
partial activations, rather than full activations, need to be stored for
gradient computation. Compared to LoRA, PaCA reduces training time by 22% and
total memory usage by 16%, while maintaining comparable accuracy across various
fine-tuning scenarios, such as fine-tuning on the MMLU dataset and instruction
tuning on the Oasst1 dataset. PaCA can also be combined with quantization,
enabling the fine-tuning of large models such as LLaMA3.1-70B. In addition,
PaCA enables training with 23% longer sequence and improves throughput by 16%

particularly in contexts characterized by data sparsity and evolving

addresses the aforementioned PdM challenges. By effectively utilizing
domain-specific knowledge, RAAD-LLM enhances the detection of anomalies in time

adaptability mechanism enables it to adjust its understanding of normal
operating conditions dynamically, thus increasing detection accuracy. We
validate this methodology through a real-world application for a plastics
manufacturing plant and the Skoltech Anomaly Benchmark (SKAB). Results show
significant improvements over our previous model with an accuracy increase from
70.7% to 88.6% on the real-world dataset. By allowing for the enriching of
input series data with semantics, RAAD-LLM incorporates multimodal capabilities
that facilitate more collaborative decision-making between the model and plant
operators. Overall, our findings support RAAD-LLM's ability to revolutionize
anomaly detection methodologies in PdM, potentially leading to a paradigm shift

code generation -- that appear to require tracking the unobserved state of an
evolving world. How do they do so? We study state tracking in LMs trained or
fine-tuned to compose permutations (i.e., to compute the order of a set of
objects after a sequence of swaps). Despite the simple algebraic structure of
this problem, many other tasks (e.g., simulation of finite automata and
evaluation of boolean expressions) can be reduced to permutation composition,
making it a natural model for state tracking in general. We show that LMs
consistently learn one of two state tracking mechanisms for this task. The
first closely resembles the ""associative scan"" construction used in recent
theoretical work by Liu et al. (2023) and Merrill et al. (2024). The second
uses an easy-to-compute feature (permutation parity) to partially prune the
space of outputs, then refines this with an associative scan. The two
mechanisms exhibit markedly different robustness properties, and we show how to
steer LMs toward one or the other with intermediate training tasks that
encourage or suppress the heuristics. Our results demonstrate that transformer
LMs, whether pretrained or fine-tuned, can learn to implement efficient and
interpretable state tracking mechanisms, and the emergence of these mechanisms
can be predicted and controlled.

proposed in [Koide and Nicacio, Phys. Lett. A494, 129277 (2024)]. We begin by
introducing a generalized model for a classical scalar field interacting with a
Brownian thermostat, consistent with stochastic thermodynamics. Applying
canonical quantization to this model, we derive the corresponding quantum
master equation, that is applicable to any form of the scalar field
Hamiltonian. While its evolution is generally non-CPTP (Completely Positive and
Trace-Preserving), it can be adjusted to describe a CPTP evolution, such as
those found in the GKSL (Gorini-Kossakowski-Sudarshan-Lindblad) equation by
appropriately tuning the parameters of the model. In this framework, we define
heat, work, and entropy in a way that satisfies the first and second laws of
quantum thermodynamics. This suggests that the quantum-classical correspondence
extends beyond closed systems governed by unitary time evolution to open
systems as well. We further investigate the relation between the second law in
quantum thermodynamics and relative entropy, providing insights into the study
of quantum fluctuations through information-theoretical techniques in quantum

capabilities, their ability to process graph data, such as molecular
structures, remains limited. To bridge this gap, this paper proposes
Graph2Token, an efficient solution that aligns graph tokens to LLM tokens. The
key idea is to represent a graph token with the LLM token vocabulary, without
fine-tuning the LLM backbone. To achieve this goal, we first construct a
molecule-text paired dataset from multisources, including CHEBI and HMDB, to
train a graph structure encoder, which reduces the distance between graphs and
texts representations in the feature space. Then, we propose a novel alignment
strategy that associates a graph token with LLM tokens. To further unleash the
potential of LLMs, we collect molecular IUPAC name identifiers, which are
incorporated into the LLM prompts. By aligning molecular graphs as special
tokens, we can activate LLM generalization ability to molecular few-shot
learning. Extensive experiments on molecular classification and regression
tasks demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed Graph2Token.

specific token sequences or stylistic patterns, into copyrighted text, allowing

watermarking techniques primarily focus on effective memorization after
pretraining, while overlooking challenges that arise in other stages of the LLM
pipeline, such as the risk of watermark filtering during data preprocessing, or
potential forgetting through post-training, or verification difficulties due to
API-only access. We propose a novel data watermarking approach that injects
coherent and plausible yet fictitious knowledge into training data using
generated passages describing a fictitious entity and its associated
attributes. Our watermarks are designed to be memorized by the LLM through
seamlessly integrating in its training data, making them harder to detect
lexically during preprocessing. We demonstrate that our watermarks can be
effectively memorized by LLMs, and that increasing our watermarks' density,
length, and diversity of attributes strengthens their memorization. We further
show that our watermarks remain robust throughout LLM development, maintaining
their effectiveness after continual pretraining and supervised finetuning.
Finally, we show that our data watermarks can be evaluated even under API-only
access via question answering.

  Specifically, we propose two GPU-oriented techniques: hybrid preprocessing

compute and memory pressure by reducing the number of irrelevant Gaussians
during rendering. The key is to combine our view-dependent scene representation
with online filtering. Meanwhile, contribution-aware rasterization improves the
GPU utilization at the rasterization stage by prioritizing Gaussians with high
contributions while reducing computations for those with low contributions.
Both techniques can be seamlessly integrated into existing 3DGS pipelines with

large models and high computational costs have limited their practical
adoption. In this paper, we first construct a high-capacity teacher model by
integrating Swin-Transformer V2-based attention modules, additional residual
blocks, and expanded latent channels, thus achieving enhanced compression
performance. Building on this foundation, we propose a \underline{F}eature and
\underline{E}ntropy-based \underline{D}istillation \underline{S}trategy
(\textbf{FEDS}) that transfers key knowledge from the teacher to a lightweight
student model. Specifically, we align intermediate feature representations and
emphasize the most informative latent channels through an entropy-based loss. A
staged training scheme refines this transfer in three phases: feature
alignment, channel-level distillation, and final fine-tuning. Our student model
nearly matches the teacher across Kodak (1.24\% BD-Rate increase), Tecnick
(1.17\%), and CLIC (0.55\%) while cutting parameters by about 63\% and
accelerating encoding/decoding by around 73\%. Moreover, ablation studies
indicate that FEDS generalizes effectively to transformer-based networks. The

well-suited for real-time or resource-limited scenarios.

engineering, particularly in the reliability assessment of high-stakes systems
such as aerospace components, medical devices, and semiconductor technologies.
Accurate reliability prognosis of NOSD testing data is essential for ensuring
product durability, safety, and performance optimization. The conventional
estimation methods like maximum likelihood estimation (MLE) are sensitive to
data contamination, leading to biased results. Consequently, this study
develops robust inferential analysis for NOSD testing data under a progressive
stress model. The lifetime of NOSD is assumed to follow Log-logistic
distribution. The estimation procedure addresses robustness by incorporating
Exponential-polynomial divergence (EPD). Equipped with three tuning parameters,
EPD based estimation is proven to be more flexible than density power
divergence estimation frequently used for one-shot device testing data
analysis. Further, we explore the asymptotic behaviour of minimum EPD estimator
(MEPDE) for large sample size. The robustness of MEPDE is analytically studied
through influence function. Since tradeoff between efficiency and robustness of
EPD based estimation is governed by three tuning parameters, a novel approach
leveraging Concrete Score Matching (CSM) is introduced to optimize the tuning
parameters of MEPDE. Moreover, a comparative study with the existing methods of
finding tuning parameters is conducted through extensive simulation experiment
and data analysis. Another aspect of this study is determining an optimal plan
to ensure a successful ALT experiment within specified budget and time
constraints. It is designed on A-optimality criteria subject to the given

optimization directions. Trained exclusively via reinforcement learning with
GRPO and without explicit reasoning data, Seg-Zero achieves robust zero-shot
generalization and exhibits emergent test-time reasoning capabilities.
Experiments show that Seg-Zero-7B achieves a zero-shot performance of 57.5 on
