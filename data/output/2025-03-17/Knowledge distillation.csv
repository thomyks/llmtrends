  distribution and device-independent quantum key distribution",Close to published version,,10.1103/PhysRevA.111.022631,,quant-ph,http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/,"  Device-independent quantum key distribution (DIQKD) aims to mitigate
adversarial exploitation of imperfections in quantum devices, by providing an
approach for secret key distillation with modest security assumptions.
Advantage distillation, a two-way communication procedure in error correction,
has proven effective in raising noise tolerances in both device-dependent and
device-independent QKD. Previously, device-independent security proofs against
IID collective attacks were developed for an advantage distillation protocol
known as the repetition-code protocol, based on security conditions involving
the fidelity between some states in the protocol. However, there exists a gap
between the sufficient and necessary security conditions, which hinders the
calculation of tight noise-tolerance bounds based on the fidelity. We close
this gap by presenting an alternative proof structure that replaces the
fidelity with the quantum Chernoff divergence, a distinguishability measure
that arises in symmetric hypothesis testing. Working in the IID collective
attacks model, we derive matching sufficient and necessary conditions for the
repetition-code protocol to be secure (up to a natural conjecture regarding the
latter case) in terms of the quantum Chernoff divergence, hence indicating that
this serves as the relevant quantity of interest for this protocol.
Furthermore, using this security condition we obtain some improvements over
previous results on the noise tolerance thresholds for DIQKD. Our results
provide insight into a fundamental question in quantum information theory
regarding the circumstances under which DIQKD is possible.

learning models in a decentralized fashion, numerous challenges persist, such
as asynchronization, computational expenses, data heterogeneity, and gradient
and membership privacy attacks. Lately, dataset distillation has emerged as a
promising solution for addressing the aforementioned challenges by generating a
compact synthetic dataset that preserves a model's training efficacy. However,
we discover that using distilled local datasets can amplify the heterogeneity
issue in FL. To address this, we propose Federated Learning on Virtual
Heterogeneous Data with Local-Global Dataset Distillation (FedLGD), where we
seamlessly integrate dataset distillation algorithms into FL pipeline and train
FL using a smaller synthetic dataset (referred as virtual data). Specifically,
to harmonize the domain shifts, we propose iterative distribution matching to
inpaint global information to local virtual data and use federated gradient
matching to distill global virtual data that serve as anchor points to rectify
heterogeneous local training, without compromising data privacy. We experiment
on both benchmark and real-world datasets that contain heterogeneous data from
different sources, and further scale up to an FL scenario that contains a large
number of clients with heterogeneous and class-imbalanced data. Our method
outperforms state-of-the-art heterogeneous FL algorithms under various
settings. Our code is available at https://github.com/ubc-tea/FedLGD.

applications in scenarios with limited computing resources, such as drones or
embedded systems. A straightforward yet powerful technique to achieve this is
knowledge distillation, which steers the learning of student networks by
leveraging the experience of already-trained teacher networks. However, it
faces a pair of challenges: Firstly, due to its two-stage training nature, a
longer training period is essential, especially as the training samples
increase. Secondly, despite the proficiency of teacher networks in transmitting
assimilated knowledge, they tend to overlook the latent insights gained during
their learning process. To address these challenges, we introduce an online
distillation learning method for remote sensing object counting. It builds an
end-to-end training framework that seamlessly integrates two distinct networks
into a unified one. It comprises a shared shallow module, a teacher branch, and
a student branch. The shared module serving as the foundation for both branches
is dedicated to learning some primitive information. The teacher branch
utilizes prior knowledge to reduce the difficulty of learning and guides the
student branch in online learning. In parallel, the student branch achieves
parameter reduction and rapid inference capabilities by means of channel
reduction. This design empowers the student branch not only to receive
privileged insights from the teacher branch but also to tap into the latent
reservoir of knowledge held by the teacher branch during the learning process.
Moreover, we propose a relation-in-relation distillation method that allows the
student branch to effectively comprehend the evolution of the relationship of
intra-layer teacher features among different inter-layer features. Extensive
experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of our method.

generate a perturbed prompt, facilitating privacy-preserving inference with
black-box LLMs, and the ""extraction module"", inspired by knowledge distillation
and retrieval-augmented generation, extracts coherent and consistent text from
the perturbed generation result, ensuring successful text generation
completion. To address privacy concerns related to previous exponential
mechanisms' susceptibility to embedding revision attacks, we introduce RANTEXT,
a novel differential privacy mechanism integrated into the perturbation module
of InferDPT, which introduces the concept of ""RANdom adjacency"" for TEXT
perturbation within the prompt. Experimental results across three datasets
demonstrate that the text generation quality of InferDPT is comparable to that
of non-private GPT-4, and RANTEXT surpasses existing state-of-the-art
mechanisms, namely, SANTEXT+ and CUSTEXT+ in the trade-off between privacy and
utility. Even with an privacy parameter epsilon value of 6.0, RANTEXT achieves
an average privacy protection rate exceeding 90% against embedding revision
attacks, which is 0.58 times higher than that of SANTEXT+ and 3.35 times higher
than that of CUSTEXT+.

global model while maintaining user data privacy. One of its branches,
decentralized FL, is a serverless network that allows clients to own and
optimize different local models separately, which results in saving management
and communication resources. Despite the promising advancements in
decentralized FL, it may reduce model generalizability due to lacking a global
model. In this scenario, managing data and model heterogeneity among clients
becomes a crucial problem, which poses a unique challenge that must be
overcome: How can every client's local model learn generalizable representation
in a decentralized manner? To address this challenge, we propose a novel
Decentralized FL technique by introducing Synthetic Anchors, dubbed as DeSA.
Based on the theory of domain adaptation and Knowledge Distillation (KD), we
theoretically and empirically show that synthesizing global anchors based on
raw data distribution facilitates mutual knowledge transfer. We further design
two effective regularization terms for local training: 1) REG loss that
regularizes the distribution of the client's latent embedding with the anchors
and 2) KD loss that enables clients to learn from others. Through extensive
experiments on diverse client data distributions, we showcase the effectiveness
of DeSA in enhancing both inter- and intra-domain accuracy of each client.

frequency responses. Second, pre-trained with frequency-filtered images, the
resulting model needs relatively more data to adapt to naturally looking images
during fine-tuning. To address these drawbacks, we propose FOurier transform
compression with seLf-Knowledge distillation (FOLK), integrating two dedicated
ideas. First, inspired by image compression, we adaptively select the
masked-out frequencies based on image frequency responses, creating more
suitable SSL tasks for pre-training. Second, we employ a two-branch framework

function. It also plays a crucial role in the budding of enveloped viruses from
host cells. We recently proposed that this process is driven by phase
separation, where the formation and growth of sorting domains depend primarily
on direct intermolecular interactions. In addition to these, Casimir-like
forces -- arising from entropic effects in fluctuating membranes -- may also
play a significant role in the molecular distillation process. Here, using a
combination of theoretical analysis and numerical simulations, we explore how
Casimir-like forces between rigid membrane inclusions contribute to sorting,
particularly in the biologically relevant regime where direct intermolecular
interactions are weak. Our results show that these forces enhance molecular
distillation by reducing the critical radius for the formation of new sorting
domains and facilitating the capture of molecules within these domains. We
identify the relative rigidity of the membrane and supermolecular domains as a
key parameter controlling molecular sorting efficiency, offering new insights
into the physical principles underlying molecular sorting in biological
systems.

high-resolution images from low-resolution inputs degraded by complex, unknown
processes. While many Stable Diffusion (SD)-based Real-ISR methods have
achieved remarkable success, their slow, multi-step inference hinders practical
deployment. Recent SD-based one-step networks like OSEDiff and S3Diff alleviate
this issue but still incur high computational costs due to their reliance on
large pretrained SD models. This paper proposes a novel Real-ISR method, AdcSR,
by distilling the one-step diffusion network OSEDiff into a streamlined
diffusion-GAN model under our Adversarial Diffusion Compression (ADC)
framework. We meticulously examine the modules of OSEDiff, categorizing them
into two types: (1) Removable (VAE encoder, prompt extractor, text encoder,
etc.) and (2) Prunable (denoising UNet and VAE decoder). Since direct removal
and pruning can degrade the model's generation capability, we pretrain our
pruned VAE decoder to restore its ability to decode images and employ
adversarial distillation to compensate for performance loss. This ADC-based
diffusion-GAN hybrid design effectively reduces complexity by 73% in inference
time, 78% in computation, and 74% in parameters, while preserving the model's
generation capability. Experiments manifest that our proposed AdcSR achieves
competitive recovery quality on both synthetic and real-world datasets,
offering up to 9.3$\times$ speedup over previous one-step diffusion-based
methods. Code and models are available at

which seeks to address the main limitations of existing semantic Gaussian
Splatting methods, namely: slow training and rendering speeds; high memory
usage; and ambiguous semantic object localization. We take a bottom-up approach
in deriving FAST-Splat, dismantling the limitations of closed-set semantic
distillation to enable open-set (open-vocabulary) semantic distillation.
Ultimately, this key approach enables FAST-Splat to provide precise semantic
object localization results, even when prompted with ambiguous user-provided
natural-language queries. Further, by exploiting the explicit form of the
Gaussian Splatting scene representation to the fullest extent, FAST-Splat
retains the remarkable training and rendering speeds of Gaussian Splatting.
Precisely, while existing semantic Gaussian Splatting methods distill semantics
into a separate neural field or utilize neural models for dimensionality
reduction, FAST-Splat directly augments each Gaussian with specific semantic
codes, preserving the training, rendering, and memory-usage advantages of
Gaussian Splatting over neural field methods. These Gaussian-specific semantic
codes, together with a hash-table, enable semantic similarity to be measured
with open-vocabulary user prompts and further enable FAST-Splat to respond with
unambiguous semantic object labels and $3$D masks, unlike prior methods. In
experiments, we demonstrate that FAST-Splat is 6x to 8x faster to train,
achieves between 18x to 51x faster rendering speeds, and requires about 6x
smaller GPU memory, compared to the best-competing semantic Gaussian Splatting

This is particularly true for biomedical images, which, unlike natural images,

state distillation protocols to process non-Clifford gates, such as T gates,
essential for universal quantum computation. In large-scale quantum
architectures capable of correcting arbitrary circuits, specialized surface
codes for data qubits and distinct codes for magic state distillation are
needed. These architectures can be organized into data blocks and distillation
blocks. The system works by having distillation blocks produce magic states and
data blocks consume them, causing stalls due to either a shortage or excess of
magic states. This bottleneck presents an opportunity to optimize quantum space
by balancing data and distillation blocks. While prior research offers insights
into selecting distillation protocols and estimating qubit requirements, it
lacks a tailored optimization approach. We present a framework for optimizing
large-scale quantum architectures, focusing on data block layouts and magic

distillation protocols under three optimization strategies: minimizing tiles,
minimizing steps, and achieving a balanced trade-off. Through a comparative
analysis of brute force, dynamic programming, greedy, and random algorithms, we
find that brute force delivers optimal results, while greedy deviates by 7% for
minimizing steps and dynamic programming matches brute force in tile
minimization. We observe that total steps increase with columns, while total
tiles scale with qubits. Finally, we propose a heuristic to help users select
algorithms suited to their objectives, enabling scalable and efficient quantum

their practical deployment, especially for interactive applications. To
accelerate generation speed, recent approaches distill a multi-step diffusion
model into a single-step student generator via variational score distillation,
which matches the distribution of samples generated by the student to the
teacher's distribution. However, these approaches use the reverse
Kullback-Leibler (KL) divergence for distribution matching which is known to be
mode seeking. In this paper, we generalize the distribution matching approach
using a novel $f$-divergence minimization framework, termed $f$-distill, that
covers different divergences with different trade-offs in terms of mode
coverage and training variance. We derive the gradient of the $f$-divergence
between the teacher and student distributions and show that it is expressed as
the product of their score differences and a weighting function determined by
their density ratio. This weighting function naturally emphasizes samples with
higher density in the teacher distribution, when using a less mode-seeking
divergence. We observe that the popular variational score distillation approach
using the reverse-KL divergence is a special case within our framework.
Empirically, we demonstrate that alternative $f$-divergences, such as
forward-KL and Jensen-Shannon divergences, outperform the current best
variational score distillation methods across image generation tasks. In
particular, when using Jensen-Shannon divergence, $f$-distill achieves current

requires significantly fewer training tokens and tunable parameters,
drastically reducing computational costs compared to prior methods. When
applied to the LLaMA3-8B model, using only 0.2% of the original pretraining

  Large-Scale Quantum Computing","6 pages, 5 figures, 3 tables",,,,quant-ph,http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-nd/4.0/,"  Quantum Error Correction (QEC), combined with magic state distillation,
ensures fault tolerance in large-scale quantum computation. To apply QEC, a
circuit must first be transformed into a non-Clifford (or T) gate set. T-depth,
the number of sequential T-gate layers, determines the magic state cost,
impacting both spatial and temporal overhead. Minimizing T-depth is crucial for
optimizing resource efficiency in fault-tolerant quantum computing. While QEC
scalability has been widely studied, T-depth reduction remains an overlooked
challenge. We establish that T-depth reduction is an NP-hard problem and
systematically evaluate multiple approximation techniques: greedy,
divide-and-conquer, Lookahead-based brute force, and graph-based. The
Lookahead-based brute-force algorithm (partition size 4) performs best,
optimizing 90\% of reducible cases (i.e., circuits where at least one algorithm
achieved optimization) with an average T-depth reduction of around 51\%.
Additionally, we introduce an expansion factor-based identity gate insertion
strategy, leveraging controlled redundancy to achieve deeper reductions in
circuits initially classified as non-reducible. With this approach, we
successfully convert up to 25\% of non-reducible circuits into reducible ones,
while achieving an additional average reduction of up to 11.8\%. Furthermore,
we analyze the impact of different expansion factor values and explore how
varying the partition size in the Lookahead-based brute-force algorithm
influences the quality of T-depth reduction.

  Cities",,,,,cs.LG cs.AI,http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/,"  Accurate origin-destination (OD) flow prediction is of great importance to
developing cities, as it can contribute to optimize urban structures and
layouts. However, with the common issues of missing regional features and
lacking OD flow data, it is quite daunting to predict OD flow in developing
cities. To address this challenge, we propose a novel Causality-Enhanced OD
Flow Prediction (CE-OFP), a unified framework that aims to transfer urban
knowledge between cities and achieve accuracy improvements in OD flow
predictions across data-scarce cities. In specific, we propose a novel
reinforcement learning model to discover universal causalities among urban
features in data-rich cities and build corresponding causal graphs. Then, we
further build Causality-Enhanced Variational Auto-Encoder (CE-VAE) to
incorporate causal graphs for effective feature reconstruction in data-scarce
cities. Finally, with the reconstructed features, we devise a knowledge
distillation method with a graph attention network to migrate the OD prediction
model from data-rich cities to data-scare cities. Extensive experiments on two
pairs of real-world datasets validate that the proposed CE-OFP remarkably
outperforms state-of-the-art baselines, which can reduce the RMSE of OD flow
prediction for data-scarce cities by up to 11%.

  Knowledge Distillation and Two-way Contrast",,,,,cs.LG cs.AI,http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/,"  Most current federated learning frameworks are modeled as static processes,
ignoring the dynamic characteristics of the learning system. Under the limited
communication budget of the central server, the flexible model architecture of
a large number of clients participating in knowledge transfer requires a lower
participation rate, active clients have uneven contributions, and the client
scale seriously hinders the performance of FL. We consider a more general and
practical federation scenario and propose a system heterogeneous federation
method based on data-free knowledge distillation and two-way contrast
(HFedCKD). We apply the Inverse Probability Weighted Distillation (IPWD)
strategy to the data-free knowledge transfer framework. The generator completes
the data features of the nonparticipating clients. IPWD implements a dynamic
evaluation of the prediction contribution of each client under different data
distributions. Based on the antibiased weighting of its prediction loss, the
weight distribution of each client is effectively adjusted to fairly integrate
the knowledge of participating clients. At the same time, the local model is
split into a feature extractor and a classifier. Through differential contrast
learning, the feature extractor is aligned with the global model in the feature
space, while the classifier maintains personalized decision-making
capabilities. HFedCKD effectively alleviates the knowledge offset caused by a
low participation rate under data-free knowledge distillation and improves the
performance and stability of the model. We conduct extensive experiments on
image and IoT datasets to comprehensively evaluate and verify the
generalization and robustness of the proposed HFedCKD framework.

  Explainable Distillation",,,,,cs.CR,http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/,"  Federated learning is a distributed learning paradigm that facilitates the
collaborative training of a global model across multiple clients while
preserving the privacy of local datasets. To address inherent challenges
related to data heterogeneity and satisfy personalized needs, a new direction
within FL, known as personalized Federated Learning (pFL), has gradually
evolved. Extensive attention has been directed toward developing novel
frameworks and methods to enhance the performance of pFL. Regrettably, the
aspect of security in pFL has been largely overlooked. Our objective is to fill
this gap. Similar to FL, pFL is susceptible to backdoor attacks. However,
existing backdoor defense strategies are primarily tailored to general FL
frameworks, and pFL lacks robustness against backdoor attacks. We propose a
novel, backdoor-robust pFL framework named BDPFL to address these challenges.
First, BDPFL introduces layer-wise mutual distillation that enables clients to
learn their personalized local models while mitigating potential backdoors.
Then, BDPFL employs explanation heatmap to learn high-quality intermediate
representations and enhance the effect of eliminating deeper and more
entrenched backdoors. Moreover, we perform empirical evaluations of BDPFL's
performance on three datasets and compare BDPFL with four backdoor defense
methods. The experiments demonstrate that BDPFL outperforms baseline methods
and is effective under various settings.

  Robustness Distillation",,,,,cs.CV,http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/,"  Adversarial Robustness Distillation (ARD) is a promising task to boost the
robustness of small-capacity models with the guidance of the pre-trained robust
teacher. The ARD can be summarized as a min-max optimization process, i.e.,
synthesizing adversarial examples (inner) & training the student (outer).
Although competitive robustness performance, existing ARD methods still have
issues. In the inner process, the synthetic training examples are far from the
teacher's decision boundary leading to important robust information missing. In
the outer process, the student model is decoupled from learning natural and
robust scenarios, leading to the robustness saturation, i.e., student
performance is highly susceptible to customized teacher selection. To tackle
these issues, this paper proposes a general Min-Max optimization Adversarial
Robustness Distillation (MMARD) method. For the inner process, we introduce the
teacher's robust predictions, which drive the training examples closer to the
teacher's decision boundary to explore more robust knowledge. For the outer
process, we propose a structured information modeling method based on
triangular relationships to measure the mutual information of the model in
natural and robust scenarios and enhance the model's ability to understand
multi-scenario mapping relationships. Experiments show our MMARD achieves
state-of-the-art performance on multiple benchmarks. Besides, MMARD is
plug-and-play and convenient to combine with existing methods.

aiding in precise localization and functional connectivity analysis.
Segmentation of white matter (WM) tracts using 3D neuroimages is vital for
understanding the brain's structural connectivity in both healthy and diseased
states. One-shot Class Incremental Semantic Segmentation (OCIS) refers to
effectively segmenting new (novel) classes using only a single sample while
retaining knowledge of old (base) classes without forgetting. Voxel-contrastive
OCIS methods adjust the feature space to alleviate the feature overlap problem
between the base and novel classes. However, since WM tract segmentation is a
multi-label segmentation task, existing single-label voxel contrastive-based
methods may cause inherent contradictions. To address this, we propose a new
multi-label voxel contrast framework called MultiCo3D for one-shot class
incremental tract segmentation. Our method utilizes uncertainty distillation to
preserve base tract segmentation knowledge while adjusting the feature space
with multi-label voxel contrast to alleviate feature overlap when learning
novel tracts and dynamically weighting multi losses to balance overall loss. We
compare our method against several state-of-the-art (SOTA) approaches. The
experimental results show that our method significantly enhances one-shot class
incremental tract segmentation accuracy across five different experimental
setups on HCP and Preto datasets.

  Samples for Visual Place Recognition",,,,,cs.CV,http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/,"  Visual place recognition is a challenging task for autonomous driving and
robotics, which is usually considered as an image retrieval problem. A commonly
used two-stage strategy involves global retrieval followed by re-ranking using
patch-level descriptors. Most deep learning-based methods in an end-to-end
manner cannot extract global features with sufficient semantic information from
RGB images. In contrast, re-ranking can utilize more explicit structural and
semantic information in one-to-one matching process, but it is time-consuming.
To bridge the gap between global retrieval and re-ranking and achieve a good
trade-off between accuracy and efficiency, we propose StructVPR++, a framework
that embeds structural and semantic knowledge into RGB global representations
via segmentation-guided distillation. Our key innovation lies in decoupling
label-specific features from global descriptors, enabling explicit semantic
alignment between image pairs without requiring segmentation during deployment.
Furthermore, we introduce a sample-wise weighted distillation strategy that
prioritizes reliable training pairs while suppressing noisy ones. Experiments
on four benchmarks demonstrate that StructVPR++ surpasses state-of-the-art
global methods by 5-23% in Recall@1 and even outperforms many two-stage
approaches, achieving real-time efficiency with a single RGB input.

computationally intensive and time-consuming. To address these challenges, we
introduce Joint Distribution Matching (JDM), a novel approach that minimizes
the reverse KL divergence between image-condition joint distributions. By
deriving a tractable upper bound, JDM decouples fidelity learning from
condition learning. This asymmetric distillation scheme enables our one-step
student to handle controls unknown to the teacher model and facilitates
improved classifier-free guidance (CFG) usage and seamless integration of human
feedback learning (HFL). Experimental results demonstrate that JDM surpasses
