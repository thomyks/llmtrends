2306.16965,Ren\'e Romen,Martin Bullinger and Ren\'e Romen,Online Coalition Formation under Random Arrival or Coalition Dissolution,,,,,cs.GT cs.DS,http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/,"  Coalition formation explores how to partition a set of $n$ agents into
disjoint coalitions according to their preferences. We consider a cardinal
utility model with an additively separable aggregation of preferences and study
the online variant of coalition formation, where the agents arrive in sequence.
The goal is to achieve competitive social welfare. In the basic model, agents
arrive in an arbitrary order and have to be assigned to coalitions immediately
and irrevocably. There, the natural greedy algorithm is known to achieve an
optimal competitive ratio, which heavily relies on the range of utilities.
  We complement this result by considering two related models. First, we study
a model where agents arrive in a random order. We find that the competitive
ratio of the greedy algorithm is $\Theta\left(\frac{1}{n^2}\right)$. In
contrast, an alternative algorithm, which is based on alternating between
waiting and greedy phases, can achieve a competitive ratio of
$\Theta\left(\frac{1}{n}\right)$. Second, we relax the irrevocability of
decisions by allowing the dissolution of coalitions into singleton coalitions.
We achieve an asymptotically optimal competitive ratio of $\Theta\left(\frac
1n\right)$ by drawing a close connection to a general model of online matching.
Hence, in both models, we obtain a competitive ratio that removes the
unavoidable utility dependencies in the basic model and essentially matches the
best possible approximation ratio by polynomial-time algorithms.

vision foundation models. Its goal is to segment objects using given reference
images. Most existing approaches adopt metric learning or masked image modeling
to build the correlation between visual prompts and input image queries. This
work approaches the problem from a fresh perspective - unlocking the capability
of the latent diffusion model (LDM) for in-context segmentation and
investigating different design choices. Specifically, we examine the problem
from three angles: instruction extraction, output alignment, and
meta-architectures. We design a two-stage masking strategy to prevent
interfering information from leaking into the instructions. In addition, we
propose an augmented pseudo-masking target to ensure the model predicts without
forgetting the original images. Moreover, we build a new and fair in-context
segmentation benchmark that covers both image and video datasets. Experiments
validate the effectiveness of our approach, demonstrating comparable or even
stronger results than previous specialist or visual foundation models. We hope
our work inspires others to rethink the unification of segmentation and
generation.

efficiency of training and inference for Transformer-based foundational models,
yielding promising results.However, the performance of SMoE heavily depends on
the choice of hyper-parameters, such as the number of experts and the number of
experts to be activated (referred to as top-k), resulting in significant
computational overhead due to the extensive model training by searching over
various hyper-parameter configurations. As a remedy, we introduce the Dynamic
Mixture of Experts (DynMoE) technique. DynMoE incorporates (1) a novel gating
method that enables each token to automatically determine the number of experts
to activate. (2) An adaptive process automatically adjusts the number of
experts during training. Extensive numerical results across Vision, Language,
and Vision-Language tasks demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach to
achieve competitive performance compared to GMoE for vision and language tasks,
and MoE-LLaVA for vision-language tasks, while maintaining efficiency by
activating fewer parameters. Our code is available at

  Model Development",,,,,cs.AI,http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/,"  Checkpointing to preserve training states is crucial during the development
of Large Foundation Models (LFMs), for training resumption upon various
failures or changes in GPU resources and parallelism configurations. In
addition, saved checkpoints are dispatched to evaluation tasks or transferred
across different training stages (e.g., from pre-training to post-training).
All these scenarios require resharding distributed checkpoints from one
parallelism to another. In production environments, different LFMs are trained
with various frameworks and storage backends, depending on model sizes and
training scales. A high-performance checkpointing system is needed to enable
efficient checkpoint management at scale throughout the lifecycle of LFM
development. We introduce ByteCheckpoint, an industrial-grade checkpointing
system for large-scale LFM training. ByteCheckpoint features: a
parallelism-agnostic checkpoint representation that enables efficient load-time
checkpoint resharding; a generic checkpoint saving/loading workflow to
accommodate multiple training frameworks and support different storage
backends; full-stack optimizations to ensure high I/O efficiency and
scalability; a suite of monitoring tools to streamline large-scale performance
analysis and bottleneck detection. Compared to existing open-source
checkpointing systems [52, 58], ByteCheckpoint significantly reduces runtime
checkpoint stalls, achieving an average reduction of 54.20x. For saving and
loading times, ByteCheckpoint achieves improvements of up to 9.96x and 8.80x,
respectively.

  Image","12 pages, 10 figures, 5 tables",,,,cs.CV,http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/,"  Recovering 3D object pose and shape from a single image is a challenging and
highly ill-posed problem. This is due to strong (self-)occlusions, depth
ambiguities, the vast intra- and inter-class shape variance, and lack of 3D
ground truth for natural images. While existing methods train deep networks on
synthetic datasets to predict 3D shapes, they often struggle to generalize to
real-world scenarios, lack an explicit feedback loop for refining noisy
estimates, and primarily focus on geometry without explicitly considering pixel
alignment. To this end, we make two key observations: (1) a robust solution
requires a model that imposes a strong category-specific shape prior to
constrain the search space, and (2) foundational models embed 2D images and 3D
shapes in joint spaces; both help resolve ambiguities. Hence, we propose SDFit,
a novel optimization framework that is built on three key innovations: First,
we use a learned morphable signed-distance-function (mSDF) model that acts as a
strong shape prior, thus constraining the shape space. Second, we use
foundational models to establish rich 2D-to-3D correspondences between image
features and the mSDF. Third, we develop a fitting pipeline that iteratively
refines both shape and pose, aligning the mSDF to the image. We evaluate SDFit
on the Pix3D, Pascal3D+, and COMIC image datasets. SDFit performs on par with
SotA methods, while demonstrating exceptional robustness to occlusions and
requiring no retraining for unseen images. Therefore, SDFit contributes new
insights for generalizing in the wild, paving the way for future research. Code
will be released.

effectively learn and reason across modalities. Through theoretical analysis
and extensive experiments, we demonstrate that our BPE Image Tokenizer
significantly enhances MLLMs' multimodal understanding capabilities, even with

research analyzes hydrology time series from the CAMELS and Caravan global

up to six observed streams and 209 static parameters across approximately 8,000

eight different model configurations for key hydrology tasks. Results
demonstrate that integrating exogenous information enhances data

  Accepted at IEEE ICRA 2025",,,,cs.CV,http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/,"  Metric depth estimation from visual sensors is crucial for robots to
perceive, navigate, and interact with their environment. Traditional range
imaging setups, such as stereo or structured light cameras, face hassles
including calibration, occlusions, and hardware demands, with accuracy limited
by the baseline between cameras. Single- and multi-view monocular depth offers
a more compact alternative, but is constrained by the unobservability of the
metric scale. Light field imaging provides a promising solution for estimating
metric depth by using a unique lens configuration through a single device.
However, its application to single-view dense metric depth is under-addressed
mainly due to the technology's high cost, the lack of public benchmarks, and
proprietary geometrical models and software. Our work explores the potential of
focused plenoptic cameras for dense metric depth. We propose a novel pipeline
that predicts metric depth from a single plenoptic camera shot by first
generating a sparse metric point cloud using machine learning, which is then
used to scale and align a dense relative depth map regressed by a foundation
depth model, resulting in dense metric depth. To validate it, we curated the
Light Field & Stereo Image Dataset (LFS) of real-world light field images with
stereo depth labels, filling a current gap in existing resources. Experimental
results show that our pipeline produces accurate metric depth predictions,
laying a solid groundwork for future research in this field.

  Detection",Accepted by CVPR 2025; Project page: https://uni-vad.github.io/,,,,cs.CV,http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-sa/4.0/,"  Visual Anomaly Detection (VAD) aims to identify abnormal samples in images
that deviate from normal patterns, covering multiple domains, including
industrial, logical, and medical fields. Due to the domain gaps between these
fields, existing VAD methods are typically tailored to each domain, with
specialized detection techniques and model architectures that are difficult to
generalize across different domains. Moreover, even within the same domain,
current VAD approaches often follow a ""one-category-one-model"" paradigm,
requiring large amounts of normal samples to train class-specific models,
resulting in poor generalizability and hindering unified evaluation across
domains. To address this issue, we propose a generalized few-shot VAD method,
UniVAD, capable of detecting anomalies across various domains, such as
industrial, logical, and medical anomalies, with a training-free unified model.
UniVAD only needs few normal samples as references during testing to detect
anomalies in previously unseen objects, without training on the specific
domain. Specifically, UniVAD employs a Contextual Component Clustering ($C^3$)
module based on clustering and vision foundation models to segment components
within the image accurately, and leverages Component-Aware Patch Matching
(CAPM) and Graph-Enhanced Component Modeling (GECM) modules to detect anomalies
at different semantic levels, which are aggregated to produce the final
detection result. We conduct experiments on nine datasets spanning industrial,
logical, and medical fields, and the results demonstrate that UniVAD achieves
state-of-the-art performance in few-shot anomaly detection tasks across
multiple domains, outperforming domain-specific anomaly detection models. Code

performance of foundation models to unprecedented levels in a variety of tasks.
Fueled by this progress, these models are becoming the prevailing approach for
a wide array of real-world vision problems, including risk-sensitive and
high-stakes applications. However, ensuring safe deployment in these scenarios
requires a more comprehensive understanding of their uncertainty modeling
capabilities, which has been barely explored. In this work, we delve into the
behaviour of vision and vision-language foundation models under Conformal
Prediction (CP), a statistical framework that provides theoretical guarantees
of marginal coverage of the true class. Across extensive experiments including
popular vision classification benchmarks, well-known foundation vision models,
and three CP methods, our findings reveal that foundation models are
well-suited for conformalization procedures, particularly those integrating
Vision Transformers. We also show that calibrating the confidence predictions
of these models, a popular strategy to improve their uncertainty
quantification, actually leads to efficiency degradation of the conformal set
on adaptive CP methods. Furthermore, few-shot adaptation of Vision-Language
Models (VLMs) to downstream tasks, whose popularity is surging, enhances
conformal scores compared to zero-shot predictions. Last, our empirical study
exposes APS as particularly promising in the context of vision foundation
models, as it does not violate the marginal coverage guarantees across multiple
challenging, yet realistic scenarios.

This task is particularly challenging because it requires both perceptual and

development of visual foundation models, progress on the cognitive aspect
remains constrained, primarily limited to either implicit learning through
simulator rollouts or explicit reliance on predefined heuristic rules. Inspired
by neuroscientific findings demonstrating that humans maintain and dynamically
update fine-grained cognitive states during object search tasks in novel
environments, we propose CogNav, a framework designed to mimic this cognitive
process using large language models. Specifically, we model the cognitive
process using a finite state machine comprising fine-grained cognitive states,
ranging from exploration to identification. Transitions between states are
determined by a large language model based on a dynamically constructed
heterogeneous cognitive map, which contains spatial and semantic information
about the scene being explored. Extensive evaluations on the HM3D, MP3D, and

significantly improves the success rate of ObjectNav at least by relative 14%

self-supervised manner on large image datasets. Analogously, substantial
evidence suggests that the human visual system (HVS) is influenced by the
statistical distribution of colors and patterns in the natural world,
characteristics also present in the training data of foundation models. The
question we address in this paper is whether foundation models trained on
natural images mimic some of the low-level characteristics of the human visual
system, such as contrast detection, contrast masking, and contrast constancy.
Specifically, we designed a protocol comprising nine test types to evaluate the
image encoders of 45 foundation and generative models. Our results indicate
that some foundation models (e.g., DINO, DINOv2, and OpenCLIP), share some of
the characteristics of human vision, but other models show little resemblance.
Foundation models tend to show smaller sensitivity to low contrast and rather
irregular responses to contrast across frequencies. The foundation models show
the best agreement with human data in terms of contrast masking. Our findings
suggest that human vision and computer vision may take both similar and
different paths when learning to interpret images of the real world. Overall,
while differences remain, foundation models trained on vision tasks start to
align with low-level human vision, with DINOv2 showing the closest resemblance.

progress in perceiving and reasoning over multimodal inquiries, ushering in a
new research era for foundation models. However, vision-language misalignment
in MLLMs has emerged as a critical challenge, where the textual responses
generated by these models are not factually aligned with the given text-image
inputs. Existing efforts to address vision-language misalignment have focused
on developing specialized vision-language connectors or leveraging visual
instruction tuning from diverse domains. In this paper, we tackle this issue
from a fundamental yet unexplored perspective by revisiting the core
architecture of MLLMs. Most MLLMs are typically built on decoder-only LLMs
consisting of a causal attention mechanism, which limits the ability of the
earlier modalities (e.g., images) to incorporate information from the latter
modalities (e.g., text). To address this problem, we propose \MapleLeaf AKI, a
novel MLLM that unlocks causal attention into modality-mutual attention (MMA)
to enable image tokens to attend to text tokens. This simple yet effective
design allows AKI to achieve superior performance in 12 multimodal
understanding benchmarks (+7.2% on average) without introducing additional
parameters and increasing training time. Our MMA design is intended to be
generic, allowing for application across various modalities, and scalable to
accommodate diverse multimodal scenarios. The code and model are publicly

token representation of tile ViT as slide-level inputs (16x16 pixels is
refereed as patch and 224x224 pixels as tile). This discards critical spatial
details from patch tokens, limiting downstream WSI analysis tasks. We find that
leveraging all spatial patch tokens benefits WSI analysis but incurs nearly
200x higher storage and training costs (e.g., 196 tokens in ViT$_{224}$). To
address this, we introduce vector quantized (VQ) distillation on patch feature,
which efficiently compresses spatial patch tokens using discrete indices and a
decoder. Our method reduces token dimensionality from 1024 to 16, achieving a
64x compression rate while preserving reconstruction fidelity. Furthermore, we
employ a multi-scale VQ (MSVQ) strategy, which not only enhances VQ
reconstruction performance but also serves as a Self-supervised Learning (SSL)
supervision for a seamless slide-level pretraining objective. Built upon the
quantized patch features and supervision targets of tile via MSVQ, we develop a
