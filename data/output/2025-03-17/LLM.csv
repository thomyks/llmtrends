  Johnston, Reza Ghanadhan, Dinesh Manocha","Is the House Ready For Sleeptime? Generating and Evaluating Situational
  Queries for Embodied Question Answering",10 Pages,,,,cs.RO cs.AI,http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/,"  We present and tackle the problem of Embodied Question Answering (EQA) with
Situational Queries (S-EQA) in a household environment. Unlike prior EQA work
tackling simple queries that directly reference target objects and properties
(""What is the color of the car?""), situational queries (such as ""Is the house
ready for sleeptime?"") are challenging as they require the agent to correctly
identify multiple object-states (Doors: Closed, Lights: Off, etc.) and reach a
consensus on their states for an answer. Towards this objective, we first
introduce a novel Prompt-Generate-Evaluate (PGE) scheme that wraps around an
LLM's output to generate unique situational queries and corresponding consensus
object information. PGE is used to generate 2K datapoints in the VirtualHome
simulator, which is then annotated for ground truth answers via a large scale
user-study conducted on M-Turk. With a high rate of answerability (97.26%) on
this study, we establish that LLMs are good at generating situational data.
However, in evaluating the data using an LLM, we observe a low correlation of
46.2% with the ground truth human annotations; indicating that while LLMs are
good at generating situational data, they struggle to answer them according to
consensus. When asked for reasoning, we observe the LLM often goes against
commonsense in justifying its answer. Finally, we utilize PGE to generate
situational data in a real-world environment, exposing LLM hallucination in
generating reliable object-states when a structured scene graph is unavailable.
To the best of our knowledge, this is the first work to introduce EQA in the
context of situational queries and also the first to present a generative
approach for query creation. We aim to foster research on improving the
real-world usability of embodied agents through this work.

approaches. However, existing models still face challenges in automatically
segmenting personalized instances in dense scenarios, where severe occlusions,
scale variations, and background clutter hinder precise instance delineation.
To address this, we propose PerSense, an end-to-end, training-free, and
model-agnostic one-shot framework for personalized instance segmentation in
dense images. We start with developing a new baseline capable of automatically
generating instance-level point prompts via proposing a novel Instance
Detection Module (IDM) that leverages density maps, encapsulating spatial
distribution of objects in an image. To reduce false positives, we design the
Point Prompt Selection Module (PPSM), which refines the output of IDM based on
an adaptive threshold. Both IDM and PPSM seamlessly integrate into our
model-agnostic framework. Furthermore, we introduce a feedback mechanism which
enables PerSense to improve the accuracy of density maps by automating the
exemplar selection process for density map generation. Finally, to promote
algorithmic advances and effective tools for this relatively underexplored
task, we introduce PerSense-D, an evaluation benchmark exclusive to
personalized instance segmentation in dense images. Our extensive experiments
establish PerSense superiority in dense scenarios compared to SOTA approaches.
Additionally, our qualitative findings demonstrate the adaptability of our
framework to images captured in-the-wild.

policies through programs as a means to achieve interpretability and
generalization. Despite promising outcomes, current state-of-the-art PRL
methods are hindered by sample inefficiency, necessitating tens of millions of
program-environment interactions. To tackle this challenge, we introduce a
novel LLM-guided search framework (LLM-GS). Our key insight is to leverage the
programming expertise and common sense reasoning of LLMs to enhance the
efficiency of assumption-free, random-guessing search methods. We address the
challenge of LLMs' inability to generate precise and grammatically correct
programs in domain-specific languages (DSLs) by proposing a Pythonic-DSL
strategy - an LLM is instructed to initially generate Python codes and then
convert them into DSL programs. To further optimize the LLM-generated programs,
we develop a search algorithm named Scheduled Hill Climbing, designed to
efficiently explore the programmatic search space to improve the programs
consistently. Experimental results in the Karel domain demonstrate our LLM-GS
framework's superior effectiveness and efficiency. Extensive ablation studies
further verify the critical role of our Pythonic-DSL strategy and Scheduled
Hill Climbing algorithm. Moreover, we conduct experiments with two novel tasks,
showing that LLM-GS enables users without programming skills and knowledge of
the domain or DSL to describe the tasks in natural language to obtain
performant programs.

relevant documents from a knowledge database and applying an LLM to the

with untrusted content are vulnerable to denial-of-service attacks we call
jamming. An adversary can add a single ``blocker'' document to the database
that will be retrieved in response to a specific query and result in the RAG
system not answering this query, ostensibly because it lacks relevant
information or because the answer is unsafe.
  We describe and measure the efficacy of several methods for generating
blocker documents, including a new method based on black-box optimization. Our
method (1) does not rely on instruction injection, (2) does not require the
adversary to know the embedding or LLM used by the target RAG system, and (3)
does not employ an auxiliary LLM.
  We evaluate jamming attacks on several embeddings and LLMs and demonstrate
that the existing safety metrics for LLMs do not capture their vulnerability to
jamming. We then discuss defenses against blocker documents.

language models. However, progress in understanding pretraining data has been
slow due to the costly pretraining runs required for data selection
experiments. We present a framework that avoids these costs and selects
high-quality pretraining data without any LLM training of our own. Our work is
based on a simple observation: LLM losses on many pretraining texts are
correlated with downstream benchmark performance, and selecting
high-correlation documents is an effective pretraining data selection method.
We build a new statistical framework for data selection centered around
estimates of perplexity-benchmark correlations and perform data selection using
a sample of 90 LLMs taken from the Open LLM Leaderboard on texts from tens of
thousands of web domains. In controlled pretraining experiments at the 160M
parameter scale on 8 benchmarks, our approach outperforms DSIR on every
benchmark, while matching the best data selector found in DataComp-LM, a
hand-engineered bigram classifier. We have now also updated this paper to

  Feedback",ICLR 2025 Spotlight; Project Page: https://DataEnvGym.github.io,,,,cs.CL cs.AI cs.LG,http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/,"  The process of creating training data to teach models is currently driven by
humans, who manually analyze model weaknesses and plan how to create data that
improves a student model. Approaches using LLMs as annotators reduce human
effort, but still require humans to interpret feedback from evaluations and
control the LLM to produce data the student needs. Automating this
labor-intensive process by creating autonomous data generation agents - or
teachers - is desirable, but requires environments that can simulate the
feedback-driven, iterative, closed loop of data creation. To enable rapid,
scalable testing for such agents and their modules, we introduce DataEnvGym, a
testbed of teacher environments for data generation agents. DataEnvGym frames
data generation as a sequential decision-making task, involving an agent
consisting of a data generation policy (which generates a plan for creating
training data) and a data generation engine (which transforms the plan into
data), inside an environment that provides student feedback. The agent's goal
is to improve student performance. Students are iteratively trained and
evaluated on generated data, and their feedback (in the form of errors or weak
skills) is reported to the agent after each iteration. DataEnvGym includes
multiple teacher environment instantiations across 3 levels of structure in the
state representation and action space. More structured environments are based
on inferred skills and offer more interpretability and curriculum control. We
support 4 domains (math, code, VQA, and tool-use) and test multiple students
and teachers. Example agents in our teaching environments can iteratively
improve students across tasks and settings. Moreover, we show that environments
teach different skill levels and test variants of key modules, pointing to
future work in improving data generation agents, engines, and feedback
mechanisms.

these insights, we propose a multi-agent framework, FS-ReasoningAgent, which
enables LLMs to recognize and learn from both factual and subjective reasoning.
Extensive experiments demonstrate that this fine-grained reasoning approach
enhances LLM trading performance in cryptocurrency markets, yielding profit
improvements of 7\% in BTC, 2\% in ETH, and 10\% in SOL. Additionally, an

correctness, which can greatly improve its deployment reliability. In this

enable LLMs to perform output-free self-evaluation. CoE consists of all
progressive hidden states produced during the inference time, which can be
treated as the latent thinking path of LLMs. We find that when LLMs respond
correctly and incorrectly, their CoE features differ, these discrepancies
assist us in estimating LLM response correctness. Experiments in four diverse
domains and seven LLMs fully demonstrate the effectiveness of our method.
Meanwhile, its label-free design intent without any training and
millisecond-level computational cost ensures real-time feedback in large-scale
scenarios. More importantly, we provide interesting insights into LLM response
correctness from the perspective of hidden state changes inside LLMs.

transparency, interpretability, and scrutability due to their reliance on dense
vector-based user embeddings. Furthermore, the cold-start problem -- where
systems have insufficient data for new users -- limits their ability to
generate accurate recommendations. Existing methods often address this by
leveraging similar trajectories from other users, but this approach can be
computationally expensive and increases the context length for LLM-based
methods, making them difficult to scale. To address these limitations, we
propose a method that generates natural language (NL) user profiles from
large-scale, location-based social network (LBSN) check-ins, utilizing robust
personality assessments and behavioral theories. These NL profiles capture user
preferences, routines, and behaviors, improving POI prediction accuracy while
offering enhanced transparency. By incorporating NL profiles as system prompts

remaining flexible, easily updated, and computationally efficient. Our method
is not only competitive with other LLM-based and complex agentic frameworks but
is also more scalable for real-world POI recommender systems. Results

constructed using Fourier series, which we can easily substitute for any linear
layer if we want the outputs to have a more continuous structure. We perform
extensive analysis on synthetic datasets, as well as on large-scale decision
making and time series forecasting tasks. We also provide theoretical evidence
that this layer can better learn signal from data while ignoring high-frequency

multimodal large language models (MLLM) have demonstrated remarkable visual

an MLLM with a decoupled perception design. Instead of having the LLM directly
predict box coordinates, we feed the output boxes from a universal proposal
network into the LLM, allowing it to output the corresponding box indices to
represent its detection results, turning the regression task into a
retrieval-based task that LLM handles more proficiently. From the data
perspective, we build a fully automated data engine and construct the
Rexverse-2M dataset which possesses multiple granularities to support the joint

with existing layout-to-image models to produce images. SLayR addresses a
domain in which current text-to-image pipelines struggle: generating scene
layouts that are of significant variety and plausibility, when the given prompt
is ambiguous and does not provide constraints on the scene. SLayR surpasses
existing baselines including LLMs in unconstrained generation, and can generate
layouts from an open caption set. To accurately evaluate the layout generation,
we introduce a new benchmark suite, including numerical metrics and a carefully
designed repeatable human-evaluation procedure that assesses the plausibility
and variety of generated images. We show that our method sets a new state of
the art for achieving both at the same time, while being at least 3x times
smaller in the number of parameters.

  Reliance on Large Language Models",,"Proceedings of the 2025 CHI Conference on Human Factors in
  Computing Systems",,,cs.HC,http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/,"  As Large Language Models become integral to decision-making, optimism about
their power is tempered with concern over their errors. Users may over-rely on
LLM advice that is confidently stated but wrong, or under-rely due to mistrust.
Reliance interventions have been developed to help users of LLMs, but they lack
rigorous evaluation for appropriate reliance. We benchmark the performance of
three relevant interventions by conducting a randomized online experiment with
400 participants attempting two challenging tasks: LSAT logical reasoning and
image-based numerical estimation. For each question, participants first
answered independently, then received LLM advice modified by one of three
reliance interventions and answered the question again. Our findings indicate
that while interventions reduce over-reliance, they generally fail to improve
appropriate reliance. Furthermore, people became more confident after making
wrong reliance decisions in certain contexts, demonstrating poor calibration.
Based on our findings, we discuss implications for designing effective reliance
interventions in human-LLM collaboration.

designed to evaluate large language models' ability to perform multi-step
reasoning in culturally specific contexts, focusing on Korean. The questions
are automatically generated via templates and algorithms, requiring LLMs to
integrate Korean cultural knowledge into sequential reasoning steps. Consistent
with prior observations on emergent abilities, our experiments reveal that
models trained on fewer than \(2 \cdot 10^{25}\) training FLOPs struggle to
solve any questions, showing near-zero performance. Beyond this threshold,
performance improves sharply. State-of-the-art models (e.g., O1) still score
under 50\%, underscoring the difficulty of our tasks. Notably, stepwise
analysis suggests the observed emergent behavior may stem from compounding
errors across multiple steps rather than reflecting a genuinely new capability.
We publicly release the benchmark and commit to regularly updating the dataset
to prevent contamination.

jailbreaks that leverages the increasing capabilities of a model to handle
paraphrases and encoded communications to bypass their defensive mechanisms.
IMPs' viability pairs and grows with a model's capabilities to handle and bind
the semantics of simple mappings between tokens and work extremely well in
practice, posing a concrete threat to the users of the most powerful LLMs in
commerce. We show how one can bypass the safeguards of the most powerful open-
and closed-source LLMs and generate content that explicitly violates their
safety policies. One can protect against IMPs by improving the guardrails and
making them scale with the LLMs' capabilities. For two categories of attacks
that are straightforward to implement, i.e., bijection and encoding, we discuss
two defensive strategies, one in token and the other in embedding space. We
conclude with some research questions we believe should be prioritised to
enhance the defensive mechanisms of LLMs and our understanding of their safety.

They can serve as markers of
individuality, cultural heritage, and personal history. However, using names as
a core indicator of identity can lead to over-simplification of complex
identities. When interacting with LLMs, user names are an important point of
information for personalisation. Names can enter chatbot conversations through
direct user input (requested by chatbots), as part of task contexts such as CV
reviews, or as built-in memory features that store user information for
personalisation. We study biases associated with names by measuring cultural
presumptions in the responses generated by LLMs when presented with common
suggestion-seeking queries, which might involve making assumptions about the
user. Our analyses demonstrate strong assumptions about cultural identity
associated with names present in LLM generations across multiple cultures. Our
work has implications for designing more nuanced personalisation systems that
avoid reinforcing stereotypes while maintaining meaningful customisation.

  Telephone Survey System at Scale",Accepted at 80th AAPOR Conference 2025,,,,cs.HC cs.CL,http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-sa/4.0/,"  Telephone surveys remain a valuable tool for gathering insights but typically
require substantial resources in training and coordinating human interviewers.
This work presents an AI-driven telephone survey system integrating
text-to-speech (TTS), a large language model (LLM), and speech-to-text (STT)
that mimics the versatility of human-led interviews (full-duplex dialogues) at
scale.
  We tested the system across two populations, a pilot study in the United
States (n = 75) and a large-scale deployment in Peru (n = 2,739), inviting
participants via web-based links and contacting them via direct phone calls.
The AI agent successfully administered open-ended and closed-ended questions,
handled basic clarifications, and dynamically navigated branching logic,
allowing fast large-scale survey deployment without interviewer recruitment or
training.
  Our findings demonstrate that while the AI system's probing for qualitative
depth was more limited than human interviewers, overall data quality approached
human-led standards for structured items. This study represents one of the
first successful large-scale deployments of an LLM-based telephone interviewer
in a real-world survey context. The AI-powered telephone survey system has the
potential for expanding scalable, consistent data collecting across market
research, social science, and public opinion studies, thus improving
operational efficiency while maintaining appropriate data quality for research.

from different backgrounds. However, toxic language and negative interactions
can hinder the participation and retention of contributors and alienate
newcomers. Proactive moderation strategies aim to prevent toxicity from
occurring by addressing conversations that have derailed from their intended
purpose. This study aims to understand and predict conversational derailment
leading to toxicity on GitHub.
  To facilitate this research, we curate a novel dataset comprising 202 toxic
conversations from GitHub with annotated derailment points, along with 696
non-toxic conversations as a baseline. Based on this dataset, we identify
unique characteristics of toxic conversations and derailment points, including
linguistic markers such as second-person pronouns, negation terms, and tones of
Bitter Frustration and Impatience, as well as patterns in conversational
dynamics between project contributors and external participants.
  Leveraging these empirical observations, we propose a proactive moderation
approach to automatically detect and address potentially harmful conversations
before escalation. By utilizing modern LLMs, we develop a conversation
trajectory summary technique that captures the evolution of discussions and
identifies early signs of derailment. Our experiments demonstrate that LLM
prompts tailored to provide summaries of GitHub conversations achieve 70%
F1-Score in predicting conversational derailment, strongly improving over a set
of baseline approaches.

2) explaining content moderation decisions by analyzing Shapley values and
LLM-guided explanations. Our primary focus is on content moderation decisions
made across countries, using pre-existing corpora sampled from the Twitter
Stream Grab. Our experiments reveal interesting patterns in censored posts,
both across countries and over time. Through human evaluations of LLM-generated

raters in rating the outputs of other generative AI (GenAI) systems, has come
to play a critical role in scaling and standardizing GenAI evaluations. To
validate judge systems, evaluators collect multiple human ratings for each item
in a validation corpus, and then aggregate the ratings into a single, per-item
gold label rating. High agreement rates between these gold labels and judge
system ratings are then taken as a sign of good judge system performance. In
many cases, however, items or rating criteria may be ambiguous, or there may be
principled disagreement among human raters. In such settings, gold labels may
not exist for many of the items. In this paper, we introduce a framework for
LLM-as-a-judge validation in the absence of gold labels. We present a
theoretical analysis drawing connections between different measures of judge
system performance under different rating elicitation and aggregation schemes.
We also demonstrate empirically that existing validation approaches can select
judge systems that are highly suboptimal, performing as much as 34% worse than
the systems selected by alternative approaches that we describe. Based on our
findings, we provide concrete recommendations for developing more reliable
approaches to LLM-as-a-judge validation.

problems (UMOPs) can be found in science, engineering, business, and
management. To handle the solution of uncertain optimization problems, robust
optimization is a relatively new field. An extended version of the projected
gradient method (PGM) for a deterministic smooth multiobjective optimization
problem (MOP) is presented in the current study as a PGM for UMOP. An
objective-wise worst-case cost (OWWC) type robust counterpart is considered,
and the PGM is used to solve a UMOP by using OWWC. A projected gradient descent
algorithm is created using theoretical findings. It is demonstrated that the
projected gradient descent algorithm's generated sequence converges to the
robust counterpart's weak Pareto optimal solution, which will be the robust
weak Pareto optimal solution for UMOP. Under a few reasonable presumptions, the
projected gradient descent algorithm's full convergent behavior is also
justified. Finally, numerical tests are presented to validate the proposed
method.
