2012.09766,Sofian Chaybouti,"Sofian Chaybouti, Achraf Saghe, Aymen Shabou","MIX : a Multi-task Learning Approach to Solve Open-Domain Question
  Answering","8 pages, 7 figures, 3 tables",,,,cs.CL,http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/,"  This paper introduces MIX, a multi-task deep learning approach to solve
open-ended question-answering. First, we design our system as a multi-stage
pipeline of 3 building blocks: a BM25-based Retriever to reduce the search
space, a RoBERTa-based Scorer, and an Extractor to rank retrieved paragraphs
and extract relevant text spans, respectively. Eventually, we further improve
the computational efficiency of our system to deal with the scalability
challenge: thanks to multi-task learning, we parallelize the close tasks solved
by the Scorer and the Extractor. Our system is on par with state-of-the-art
performances on the squad-open benchmark while being simpler conceptually.

2503.03612,Kemal Kirtac,Kemal Kirtac and Guido Germano,Large language models in finance : what is financial sentiment?,,,,,q-fin.ST q-fin.GN,http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/,"  Financial sentiment has become a crucial yet complex concept in finance,
increasingly used in market forecasting and investment strategies. Despite its
growing importance, there remains a need to define and understand what
financial sentiment truly represents and how it can be effectively measured. We
explore the nature of financial sentiment and investigate how large language
models (LLMs) contribute to its estimation. We trace the evolution of sentiment
measurement in finance, from market-based and lexicon-based methods to advanced
natural language processing techniques. The emergence of LLMs has significantly
enhanced sentiment analysis, providing deeper contextual understanding and
greater accuracy in extracting sentiment from financial text. We examine how
BERT-based models, such as RoBERTa and FinBERT, are optimized for structured
sentiment classification, while GPT-based models, including GPT-4, OPT, and
LLaMA, excel in financial text generation and real-time sentiment
interpretation. A comparative analysis of bidirectional and autoregressive
transformer architectures highlights their respective roles in investor
sentiment analysis, algorithmic trading, and financial decision-making. By
exploring what financial sentiment is and how it is estimated within LLMs, we
provide insights into the growing role of AI-driven sentiment analysis in
finance.
