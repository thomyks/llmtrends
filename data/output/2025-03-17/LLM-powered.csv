expertise and tools, multi-agent systems achieve impressive progress in solving
real-world problems. Given the user queries, the meta-agents, serving as the
brain within multi-agent systems, are required to decompose the queries into
multiple sub-tasks that can be allocated to suitable agents capable of solving
them, so-called agent-oriented planning. In this study, we identify three
critical design principles of agent-oriented planning, including solvability,
completeness, and non-redundancy, to ensure that each sub-task can be
effectively resolved, resulting in satisfactory responses to user queries.
These principles further inspire us to propose AOP, a novel framework for
agent-oriented planning in multi-agent systems, leveraging a fast task
decomposition and allocation process followed by an effective and efficient
evaluation via a reward model. According to the evaluation results, the
meta-agent is also responsible for promptly making necessary adjustments to
sub-tasks and scheduling. Besides, we integrate a feedback loop into AOP to
further enhance the effectiveness and robustness of such a problem-solving
process. Extensive experiments demonstrate the advancement of AOP in solving
real-world problems compared to both single-agent systems and existing planning
strategies for multi-agent systems. The source code is available at
