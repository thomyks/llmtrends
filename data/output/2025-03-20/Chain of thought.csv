  Reasoning Patterns",,,,,cs.CL,http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/,"  Chain of Thought (CoT) prompting can encourage language models to engage in
multi-step logical reasoning. The quality of the provided demonstrations
significantly influences the success of downstream inference tasks. Current
unsupervised CoT methods primarily select examples based on the semantics of
the questions, which can introduce noise and lack interpretability. In this
paper, we propose leveraging reasoning patterns to enhance CoT prompting
effectiveness. Reasoning patterns represent the process by which language
models arrive at their final results. By utilizing prior knowledge and
prompt-based methods from large models, we first construct task-specific
pattern sets. We then select diverse demonstrations based on different
reasoning patterns. This approach not only mitigates the impact of noise but
also provides explicit interpretability to help us understand the mechanisms of
CoT. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our method is more robust and
consistently leads to improvements across various reasoning tasks.

  Large Language Models",,,,,cs.CL cs.AI,http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/,"  Advanced reasoning in large language models has achieved remarkable
performance on challenging tasks, but the prevailing long-context reasoning
paradigm faces critical limitations: quadratic computational scaling with
sequence length, reasoning constrained by maximum context boundaries, and
performance degradation beyond pre-training context windows. Existing
approaches primarily compress reasoning chains without addressing the
fundamental scaling problem. To overcome these challenges, we introduce
InftyThink, a paradigm that transforms monolithic reasoning into an iterative
process with intermediate summarization. By interleaving short reasoning
segments with concise progress summaries, our approach enables unbounded
reasoning depth while maintaining bounded computational costs. This creates a
characteristic sawtooth memory pattern that significantly reduces computational
complexity compared to traditional approaches. Furthermore, we develop a
methodology for reconstructing long-context reasoning datasets into our
iterative format, transforming OpenR1-Math into 333K training instances.
Experiments across multiple model architectures demonstrate that our approach
reduces computational costs while improving performance, with Qwen2.5-Math-7B
showing 3-13% improvements across MATH500, AIME24, and GPQA_diamond benchmarks.
Our work challenges the assumed trade-off between reasoning depth and
computational efficiency, providing a more scalable approach to complex
reasoning without architectural modifications.

  Workshop (ICLR 25), 10 main paper pages, 38 appendix pages",,,,cs.AI cs.CL cs.LG,http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/,"  Chain-of-Thought (CoT) reasoning has significantly advanced state-of-the-art
AI capabilities. However, recent studies have shown that CoT reasoning is not
always faithful, i.e. CoT reasoning does not always reflect how models arrive
at conclusions. So far, most of these studies have focused on unfaithfulness in
unnatural contexts where an explicit bias has been introduced. In contrast, we
show that unfaithful CoT can occur on realistic prompts with no artificial
bias. Our results reveal non-negligible rates of several forms of unfaithful
reasoning in frontier models: Sonnet 3.7 (16.3%), DeepSeek R1 (5.3%) and
ChatGPT-4o (7.0%) all answer a notable proportion of question pairs
unfaithfully. Specifically, we find that models rationalize their implicit
biases in answers to binary questions (""implicit post-hoc rationalization"").
For example, when separately presented with the questions ""Is X bigger than Y?""
and ""Is Y bigger than X?"", models sometimes produce superficially coherent
arguments to justify answering Yes to both questions or No to both questions,
despite such responses being logically contradictory. We also investigate
restoration errors (Dziri et al., 2023), where models make and then silently
correct errors in their reasoning, and unfaithful shortcuts, where models use
clearly illogical reasoning to simplify solving problems in Putnam questions (a
hard benchmark). Our findings raise challenges for AI safety work that relies
on monitoring CoT to detect undesired behavior.

OpenAI-O1 and DeepSeek-R1, have demonstrated their impressive capabilities in
complex domains like mathematics and coding. A central factor in their success
lies in the application of long chain-of-thought (Long CoT) characteristics,
which enhance reasoning abilities and enable the solution of intricate
problems. However, despite these developments, a comprehensive survey on Long
CoT is still lacking, limiting our understanding of its distinctions from
traditional short chain-of-thought (Short CoT) and complicating ongoing debates
on issues like ""overthinking"" and ""test-time scaling."" This survey seeks to
fill this gap by offering a unified perspective on Long CoT. (1) We first
distinguish Long CoT from Short CoT and introduce a novel taxonomy to
categorize current reasoning paradigms. (2) Next, we explore the key
characteristics of Long CoT: deep reasoning, extensive exploration, and
feasible reflection, which enable models to handle more complex tasks and
produce more efficient, coherent outcomes compared to the shallower Short CoT.
(3) We then investigate key phenomena such as the emergence of Long CoT with
these characteristics, including overthinking, and test-time scaling, offering
insights into how these processes manifest in practice. (4) Finally, we
identify significant research gaps and highlight promising future directions,
including the integration of multi-modal reasoning, efficiency improvements,
and enhanced knowledge frameworks. By providing a structured overview, this
survey aims to inspire future research and further the development of logical

  Detection",,,,,cs.CV,http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/,"  Recently, a task of Single-Domain Generalized Object Detection (Single-DGOD)
is proposed, aiming to generalize a detector to multiple unknown domains never
seen before during training. Due to the unavailability of target-domain data,
some methods leverage the multimodal capabilities of vision-language models,
using textual prompts to estimate cross-domain information, enhancing the
model's generalization capability. These methods typically use a single textual
prompt, often referred to as the one-step prompt method. However, when dealing
with complex styles such as the combination of rain and night, we observe that
the performance of the one-step prompt method tends to be relatively weak. The
reason may be that many scenes incorporate not just a single style but a
combination of multiple styles. The one-step prompt method may not effectively
synthesize combined information involving various styles. To address this
limitation, we propose a new method, i.e., Style Evolving along
Chain-of-Thought, which aims to progressively integrate and expand style
information along the chain of thought, enabling the continual evolution of
styles. Specifically, by progressively refining style descriptions and guiding
the diverse evolution of styles, this approach enables more accurate simulation
of various style characteristics and helps the model gradually learn and adapt
to subtle differences between styles. Additionally, it exposes the model to a
broader range of style features with different data distributions, thereby
enhancing its generalization capability in unseen domains. The significant
performance gains over five adverse-weather scenarios and the Real to Art
benchmark demonstrate the superiorities of our method.

  Multimodal Model Collective Reasoning",WWW 2025,,,,cs.IR cs.AI cs.MM,http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-nd/4.0/,"  With the proliferation of images in online content, language-guided image
retrieval (LGIR) has emerged as a research hotspot over the past decade,
encompassing a variety of subtasks with diverse input forms. While the
development of large multimodal models (LMMs) has significantly facilitated
these tasks, existing approaches often address them in isolation, requiring the
construction of separate systems for each task. This not only increases system
complexity and maintenance costs, but also exacerbates challenges stemming from
language ambiguity and complex image content, making it difficult for retrieval
systems to provide accurate and reliable results. To this end, we propose
ImageScope, a training-free, three-stage framework that leverages collective
reasoning to unify LGIR tasks. The key insight behind the unification lies in
the compositional nature of language, which transforms diverse LGIR tasks into
a generalized text-to-image retrieval process, along with the reasoning of LMMs
serving as a universal verification to refine the results. To be specific, in
the first stage, we improve the robustness of the framework by synthesizing
search intents across varying levels of semantic granularity using
chain-of-thought (CoT) reasoning. In the second and third stages, we then
reflect on retrieval results by verifying predicate propositions locally, and
performing pairwise evaluations globally. Experiments conducted on six LGIR
datasets demonstrate that ImageScope outperforms competitive baselines.
Comprehensive evaluations and ablation studies further confirm the
effectiveness of our design.

signals. Additionally, PRISM leverages Chain-of-Thought (CoT) reasoning to
incorporate long-horizon considerations, thereby preventing the short-sighted
feedback often seen in static preference comparisons. In contrast to
conventional PBRL techniques, this integration of 3D perception and
future-oriented reasoning leads to significant gains in preference agreement
rates, faster policy convergence, and robust generalization across unseen

leveraging Chain-of-Thought reasoning (CoT), have opened brand new possibility
for Machine Translation (MT). This position paper argues that LRMs
substantially transformed traditional neural MT as well as LLMs-based MT
paradigms by reframing translation as a dynamic reasoning task that requires
contextual, cultural, and linguistic understanding and reasoning. We identify
three foundational shifts: 1) contextual coherence, where LRMs resolve
ambiguities and preserve discourse structure through explicit reasoning over
cross-sentence and complex context or even lack of context; 2) cultural
intentionality, enabling models to adapt outputs by inferring speaker intent,
audience expectations, and socio-linguistic norms; 3) self-reflection, LRMs can
perform self-reflection during the inference time to correct the potential
errors in translation especially extremely noisy cases, showing better
robustness compared to simply mapping X->Y translation. We explore various
scenarios in translation including stylized translation, document-level
translation and multimodal translation by showcasing empirical examples that
demonstrate the superiority of LRMs in translation. We also identify several
interesting phenomenons for LRMs for MT including auto-pivot translation as
well as the critical challenges such as over-localisation in translation and
inference efficiency. In conclusion, we think that LRMs redefine translation
systems not merely as text converters but as multilingual cognitive agents
capable of reasoning about meaning beyond the text. This paradigm shift reminds
us to think of problems in translation beyond traditional translation scenarios
in a much broader context with LRMs - what we can achieve on top of it.

of LMMs: scientific knowledge comprehension, multi-modal content
interpretation, and Chain-of-Thought (CoT) reasoning. To unveil whether LMMs
possess sufficient scientific expertise, we first transform each problem into
three versions containing different levels of knowledge required for solving,
i.e., Knowledge-free, -lite, and -rich. Then, to explore how LMMs interpret
multi-modal scientific content, we annotate another two versions, i.e.,
Vision-rich and -only, marking more question information from texts to
diagrams. Comparing the results of different versions, SciVerse systematically
examines the professional knowledge stock and visual perception skills of LMMs
in scientific domains. In addition, to rigorously assess CoT reasoning, we
propose a new scientific CoT evaluation strategy, conducting a step-wise
assessment on knowledge and logical errors in model outputs. Our extensive
evaluation of different LMMs on SciVerse reveals critical limitations in their
scientific proficiency and provides new insights into future developments.
