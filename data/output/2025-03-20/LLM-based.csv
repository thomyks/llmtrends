2410.04070,Ruizhe Chen,"Ruizhe Chen, Xiaotian Zhang, Meng Luo, Wenhao Chai, and Zuozhu Liu",PAD: Personalized Alignment of LLMs at Decoding-Time,ICLR 2025,,,,cs.CL cs.AI,http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/,"  Aligning with personalized preferences, which vary significantly across
cultural, educational, and political differences, poses a significant challenge
due to the computational costs and data demands of traditional alignment
methods. In response, this paper presents Personalized Alignment at
Decoding-time (PAD), a novel framework designed to align LLM outputs with
diverse personalized preferences during the inference phase, eliminating the
need for additional training. By introducing a unique personalized reward
modeling strategy, this framework decouples the text generation process from
personalized preferences, facilitating the generation of generalizable
token-level personalized rewards. The PAD algorithm leverages these rewards to
guide the decoding process, dynamically tailoring the base model's predictions
to personalized preferences. Extensive experimental results demonstrate that
PAD not only outperforms existing training-based alignment methods in terms of
aligning with diverse preferences but also shows significant generalizability
to preferences unseen during training and scalability across different base
models. This work advances the capability of LLMs to meet user needs in
real-time applications, presenting a substantial step forward in personalized
LLM alignment.
