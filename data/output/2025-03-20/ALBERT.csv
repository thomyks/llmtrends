simulations, the polymerisation of the unsaturated cis dinitrogen-difluoride
(cis-N2F2) molecular compound is investigated. The thermodynamic, dynamical and
thermal stabilities of the nitrogen fluorine NF system are investigated at
conditions of 0-3000 K and 0-200 GPa. The cis-N2F2 molecule is a suitable
precursor to obtain one-dimensional polymerized nitrogen-fluorine (poly-NF)
chains at a pressure above 90 GPa and at a temperature around 1900 K.
Importantly, these poly-NF chains can be quenched to room conditions, and
potentially serve as a High-energy-density materials (HEDM). It has been
established that when Al is utilised as a reducing agent, poly-NF chains
exhibit a gravimetric energy density of 13.55 kJ/g, which exceeds that of cubic
gauche nitrogen (cg-N, 9.70 kJ/g). This is attributable to the presence of both
polymerised nitrogen and strong oxidising F atoms.
