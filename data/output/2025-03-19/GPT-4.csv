  Zhiqiang Shen","A Frustratingly Simple Yet Highly Effective Attack Baseline: Over 90%
  Success Rate Against the Strong Black-box Models of GPT-4.5/4o/o1",Code at: https://github.com/VILA-Lab/M-Attack,,,,cs.CV cs.AI cs.LG,http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/,"  Despite promising performance on open-source large vision-language models
(LVLMs), transfer-based targeted attacks often fail against black-box
commercial LVLMs. Analyzing failed adversarial perturbations reveals that the
learned perturbations typically originate from a uniform distribution and lack
clear semantic details, resulting in unintended responses. This critical
absence of semantic information leads commercial LVLMs to either ignore the
perturbation entirely or misinterpret its embedded semantics, thereby causing
the attack to fail. To overcome these issues, we notice that identifying core
semantic objects is a key objective for models trained with various datasets
and methodologies. This insight motivates our approach that refines semantic
clarity by encoding explicit semantic details within local regions, thus
ensuring interoperability and capturing finer-grained features, and by
concentrating modifications on semantically rich areas rather than applying
them uniformly. To achieve this, we propose a simple yet highly effective
solution: at each optimization step, the adversarial image is cropped randomly
by a controlled aspect ratio and scale, resized, and then aligned with the
target image in the embedding space. Experimental results confirm our
hypothesis. Our adversarial examples crafted with local-aggregated
perturbations focused on crucial regions exhibit surprisingly good
transferability to commercial LVLMs, including GPT-4.5, GPT-4o,
Gemini-2.0-flash, Claude-3.5-sonnet, Claude-3.7-sonnet, and even reasoning
models like o1, Claude-3.7-thinking and Gemini-2.0-flash-thinking. Our approach
achieves success rates exceeding 90% on GPT-4.5, 4o, and o1, significantly
outperforming all prior state-of-the-art attack methods. Our optimized
adversarial examples under different configurations and training code are
available at https://github.com/VILA-Lab/M-Attack.
