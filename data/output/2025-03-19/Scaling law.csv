  longitudinal data",,,,,stat.CO cs.LG,http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/,"  Gaussian process (GP) models that combine both categorical and continuous
input variables have found use in analysis of longitudinal data and computer
experiments. However, standard inference for these models has the typical cubic
scaling, and common scalable approximation schemes for GPs cannot be applied
since the covariance function is non-continuous. In this work, we derive a
basis function approximation scheme for mixed-domain covariance functions,
which scales linearly with respect to the number of observations and total
number of basis functions. The proposed approach is naturally applicable to
also Bayesian GP regression with discrete observation models. We demonstrate
the scalability of the approach and compare model reduction techniques for
additive GP models in a longitudinal data context. We confirm that we can
approximate the exact GP model accurately in a fraction of the runtime compared
to fitting the corresponding exact model. In addition, we demonstrate a
scalable model reduction workflow for obtaining smaller and more interpretable
models when dealing with a large number of candidate predictors.

may have important applications in soft robotics, sound reduction and
biomedicine. To design these innovative materials, it is important to be able
to simulate them accurately and quickly, in order to tune their mechanical
properties. Since conventional simulations using the finite element method
entail a high computational cost, in this article we aim to develop a machine
learning-based approach that scales favorably to serve as a surrogate model. To
ensure that the model is also able to handle various microstructures, including
those not encountered during training, we include the microstructure as part of
the network input. Therefore, we introduce a graph neural network that predicts
global quantities (energy, stress stiffness) as well as the pattern
transformations that occur (the kinematics). To make our model as accurate and
data-efficient as possible, various symmetries are incorporated into the model.
The starting point is an E(n)-equivariant graph neural network (which respects
translation, rotation and reflection) that has periodic boundary conditions
(i.e., it is in-/equivariant with respect to the choice of RVE), is scale
in-/equivariant, can simulate large deformations, and can predict scalars,
vectors as well as second and fourth order tensors (specifically energy, stress
and stiffness). The incorporation of scale equivariance makes the model
equivariant with respect to the similarities group, of which the Euclidean
group E(n) is a subgroup. We show that this network is more accurate and
data-efficient than graph neural networks with fewer symmetries. To create an
efficient graph representation of the finite element discretization, we use
only the internal geometrical hole boundaries from the finite element mesh to
achieve a better speed-up and scaling with the mesh size.

the competition between AR and external potentials, revealing that

active particles to the potential, finding that active reorientation
significantly increases aggregation on one side of the asymmetric potential
well. Additionally, by calculating the mean squared displacement and scaling

active particles with active reorientation are more sensitive to variations in

  available at https://github.com/MathematicalAI-NUS/Monomial-NFN",,,,cs.LG,http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/,"  Neural functional networks (NFNs) have recently gained significant attention
due to their diverse applications, ranging from predicting network
generalization and network editing to classifying implicit neural
representation. Previous NFN designs often depend on permutation symmetries in
neural networks' weights, which traditionally arise from the unordered
arrangement of neurons in hidden layers. However, these designs do not take
into account the weight scaling symmetries of $\ReLU$ networks, and the weight
sign flipping symmetries of $\sin$ or $\Tanh$ networks. In this paper, we
extend the study of the group action on the network weights from the group of
permutation matrices to the group of monomial matrices by incorporating
scaling/sign-flipping symmetries. Particularly, we encode these
scaling/sign-flipping symmetries by designing our corresponding equivariant and
invariant layers. We name our new family of NFNs the Monomial Matrix Group
Equivariant Neural Functional Networks (Monomial-NFN). Because of the expansion
of the symmetries, Monomial-NFN has much fewer independent trainable parameters
compared to the baseline NFNs in the literature, thus enhancing the model's
efficiency. Moreover, for fully connected and convolutional neural networks, we
theoretically prove that all groups that leave these networks invariant while
acting on their weight spaces are some subgroups of the monomial matrix group.
We provide empirical evidence to demonstrate the advantages of our model over
existing baselines, achieving competitive performance and efficiency.

  convection in unstably stratified flows","39 pages, 11 figures",,,,physics.flu-dyn,http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/,"  This study proposes a global similarity correction for Reynolds-averaged
Navier--Stokes (RANS) modeling of buoyancy effects in unstably stratified
flows. Conventional two-equation RANS models (e.g., the $k$-$\varepsilon$
model) lack a clear criterion for incorporating unstable buoyancy effects in
their scale-determining equations (e.g., $\varepsilon$-equation). To address
this gap, a global correction function is introduced, derived from a
generalized algebraic formulation that incorporates available potential energy
as an additional parameter. This function reproduces a global similarity law
commonly observed in natural convection flows--for instance, the correlation
among the Nusselt, Rayleigh, and Prandtl numbers, which can be approximately
expressed as a single power law over a wide parameter range. A calibration
method is proposed in which an approximate analytical solution for
Rayleigh--B\'enard convection is obtained via equilibrium analysis, confirming
that the proposed model captures similarity relations not addressed by
conventional one-point closures. Numerical results show significantly improved
agreement with experimental data, accurately reproducing Nusselt number
dependencies over broad ranges of Rayleigh and Prandtl numbers in unstably
stratified flows, such as Rayleigh--B\'enard convection and two types of
internally heated convection. The method remains fully compatible with standard
RANS frameworks and reverts to traditional turbulence treatments in
shear-driven flows where buoyant effects are negligible. By introducing only a
single, simple, algebraic global function in the conventional
$\varepsilon$-equation, this approach significantly enhances the accuracy and
robustness of buoyancy-driven turbulence simulations.

Adam-type algorithms, accelerating training, boosting performance, and
improving generalization in deep learning. Combining projected gradient

on the decoupling of first-order moment estimation coefficients and
second-order moment estimation coefficients. Unlike prior work relying on , our

  recent long-period comets",Accepted by A&A,,,,astro-ph.EP,http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/,"  Context. Dust halos or shells, along with linear dark structures along the
axes of dust tails, are commonly observed in many long-period comets near
perihelion. Examples range from the recent C/2023 A3 (Tsuchinshan-ATLAS) to
historical comets such as the Great Comet of 1874, C/1874 H1 (Coggia).
  Aims. While dust halos can readily be modeled as spin-modulated activity
originating from the comet nucleus, their possible connection to those dark
linear features has, to our knowledge, not been investigated. The aim of this
paper is to shed light on the formation of these remarkable structures by
modeling a sample of six long-period comets, using similar dust physical
properties and ejection parameters, to explore whether they share a common
origin.
  Methods. To model the dust features, we employed a Monte Carlo procedure to
generate synthetic images. The particles ejected from the comet nucleus follow
a power-law size distribution and are released into interplanetary space at
speeds determined by the ratio of solar radiation pressure to solar gravity,
the heliocentric distance, and, as a new feature of the code, the solar zenith
angle at the emission point.
  Results. We demonstrate that, in all the cases analyzed, the dust shells form
as a result of short-term events characterized by cyclically varying ejection
of very small particles from large surface areas on the rotating nucleus. These
events are triggered as these areas become freshly exposed to solar radiation
near perihelion due to the high obliquity of the spin axes of their nuclei. The
dark linear stripes along the tail axes may arise from a specific dependence of
the ejection speeds on the square root of the cosine of the zenith angle, as is
predicted by hydrodynamical modeling, but their presence is also dependent on
the extent of the latitude region of emission that defines the velocity vector
field.

properties of the SWDL are derived, including marginal distributions, energy
conservations, unique reconstruction, Moyal formula, complex conjugate
symmetry, time reversal symmetry, scaling property, time translation property,
frequency modulation property, and time translation and frequency modulation
property. Heisenberg's uncertainty principles of the SWDL are formulated,
giving rise to three kinds of lower bounds attainable respectively by Gaussian

chirp signal. The optimal symplectic matrices corresponding to the highest
time-frequency resolution are generated by solving the lower bound optimization

verify the feasibility and reliability of the theoretical analysis.

have fueled breakthroughs in remote sensing (RS) foundation models. However,
the quadratic complexity of self-attention poses a significant barrier to
scalability, particularly for large models and high-resolution images. While
the linear-complexity Mamba architecture offers a promising alternative,
existing RS applications of Mamba remain limited to supervised tasks on small,
domain-specific datasets. To address these challenges, we propose RoMA, a
framework that enables scalable self-supervised pretraining of Mamba-based RS
foundation models using large-scale, diverse, unlabeled data. RoMA enhances
scalability for high-resolution images through a tailored auto-regressive
learning strategy, incorporating two key innovations: 1) a rotation-aware
pretraining mechanism combining adaptive cropping with angular embeddings to
handle sparsely distributed objects with arbitrary orientations, and 2)
multi-scale token prediction objectives that address the extreme variations in
object scales inherent to RS imagery. Systematic empirical studies validate
that Mamba adheres to RS data and parameter scaling laws, with performance
scaling reliably as model and data size increase. Furthermore, experiments
across scene classification, object detection, and semantic segmentation tasks
demonstrate that RoMA-pretrained Mamba models consistently outperform ViT-based
counterparts in both accuracy and computational efficiency. The source code and

and molecular media, such as dye solutions and alkali-noble buffer gas mixtures
at high pressure, in many cases there exists a universal scaling, the
Kennard-Stepanov relation, which is a manifestation of detailed balance. This
relation plays a crucial role in recent Bose-Einstein condensation experiments
of visible-spectral-photons in e.g. dye-solution-filled optical microcavities.
It has recently been proposed to use high-pressure xenon-noble gas mixtures as
a thermalization medium for vacuum-ultraviolet regime photons, so as to extend
the achievable wavelength range of such Bose-Einstein-condensed optical sources
from the visible to the vacuum-ultraviolet regime. In this work, we report
two-photon excitation spectroscopy measurements of ground state ($5p^6$) xenon
atoms subject to up to 80bar of helium or krypton buffer gas pressure,
respectively, in the 220nm - 260nm wavelength range. The study of such
two-photon spectra is of interest e.g. for the exploration of possible pumping
schemes of a future vacuum-ultraviolet photon Bose-Einstein condensate. We have
also recorded absorption and emission spectra of the $5p^6 \leftrightarrow
5p^56s$ single-photon transition near 147nm wavelength of xenon atoms subject
to 80bar of krypton buffer gas pressure. We find that the ratio of absorption
and emission follows a Kennard-Stepanov scaling, which suggests that such gas
mixtures are promising candidates as a thermalization medium for a
Bose-Einstein condensate of vacuum-ultraviolet photons.

reveals that the ratio of longitudinal shear viscosity to entropy density
$\eta_\parallel/s$ exhibits a pronounced non-monotonic dependence on
temperature $T$ when the magnetic field $B$ is slightly below the critical
value $B_c$ of the quantum phase transition. In particular, it can develop a
distinct minimum at an intermediate temperature. This contrasts sharply with
the monotonic temperature scaling observed at and above $B_c$, where
$\eta_\parallel/s$ follows the scaling $T^{2/3}$ at $B=B_c$ and transitions to
$T^2$ for $B>B_c$ as $T\to0$. The non-vanishing of $\eta_\parallel/s$ for
$B<B_c$ in the zero temperature limit suggests that it could serve as a good
order parameter of the quantum phase transition. We also find that all
butterfly velocities change dramatically near the quantum phase transition, and
thus their derivatives with respect to $B$ can be independently used to detect
the quantum critical point.
