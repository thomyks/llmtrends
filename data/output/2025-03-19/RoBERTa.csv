  Answering","8 pages, 7 figures, 3 tables",,,,cs.CL,http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/,"  This paper introduces MIX, a multi-task deep learning approach to solve
open-ended question-answering. First, we design our system as a multi-stage
pipeline of 3 building blocks: a BM25-based Retriever to reduce the search
space, a RoBERTa-based Scorer, and an Extractor to rank retrieved paragraphs
and extract relevant text spans, respectively. Eventually, we further improve
the computational efficiency of our system to deal with the scalability
challenge: thanks to multi-task learning, we parallelize the close tasks solved
by the Scorer and the Extractor. Our system is on par with state-of-the-art
performances on the squad-open benchmark while being simpler conceptually.
