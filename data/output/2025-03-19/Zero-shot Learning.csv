2501.13859,Shiyu Zhang,"Shiyu Zhang, Cheng Yan, Yang Liu, Chenchen Jing, Lei Zhou, Wenjun Wang",Learning Visual Proxy for Compositional Zero-Shot Learning,,,,,cs.CV,http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/,"  Compositional Zero-Shot Learning (CZSL) aims to recognize novel
attribute-object compositions by leveraging knowledge from seen compositions.
Existing methods align textual prototypes with visual features through
Vision-Language Models (VLMs), but they face two key limitations: (1) modality
gaps hinder the discrimination of semantically similar composition pairs, and
(2) single-modal textual prototypes lack fine-grained visual cues, creating
bottlenecks in VLM-based CZSL. In this paper, we introduce Visual Proxy
Learning, a novel approach that facilitates the learning of distinct visual
distributions, effectively reducing the modality gap and improving
compositional generalization performance. Specifically, we initialize visual
proxies for various attributes, objects, and their compositions using text
representations. By optimizing the visual space, we capture fine-grained visual
cues and guide the learning of more discriminative visual representations for
attributes, objects and compositions. Furthermore, we propose an effective
Cross-Modal Joint Learning (CMJL) strategy that imposes cross-modal constraints
between the original text-image space and the fine-grained visual space. This
approach not only boosts generalization for previously unseen composition pairs
but also sharpens the discrimination of similar pairs, fostering more robust
and precise learning. Extensive experiments demonstrate state-of-the-art
performance in closed-world scenarios and competitive open-world results across
four established CZSL benchmarks, validating the effectiveness of our approach
in advancing compositional generalization.
